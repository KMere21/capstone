Pantheon Blend No.1,Starbucks Reserve Roastery,"Seattle, Washington",Guatemala; West Java; Colombia.,Medium-Dark,39/47,$30.00/16 ounces,May 2015,92,Aroma:,9,Body:,8							,Flavor:,8,Aftertaste:,8,With Milk:,9,"Blind Assessment: Evaluated as espresso. Very discreetly and mildly roast-toned. Ken (93) found the hint of roast fine, maybe even refreshing given all of the bright, lighter-roasted espressos he tastes, but Ethan (91) was not entirely happy with the roasty suggestions. Chocolaty and floral yes, but he also found the blend “bittersweet,” “dry”, even “gritty,” and “lacking complexity overall.” The term “dry” found its way into Ken’s notes as well, but nevertheless he appreciated the chocolate, the caramel, the raisin, the flowers and for him a pleasant hint of anise. True, Ethan did fall in line with Ken when it came to sampling the blend in three parts milk, where both found the chocolate and caramel notes appealing and the floral notes surprisingly clear and persistent. ","Notes: The Pantheon Blend is a limited edition open-source seasonal espresso blend, one of an array of very select small-lot coffees that together demonstrates the entry of Starbucks into the new, highest-end specialty coffee scene. This blend was roasted on a small-batch roaster and is only available for purchase at the palatial new Starbucks Reserve Roastery location in Seattle. Note that most of the rest of the Starbucks Reserve coffees, including all of those that can be purchased online or off-site, are roasted on a considerably larger batch-roaster located on the lower level of the Reserve Roastery, and based on our sampling are roasted considerably darker than the highest-end coffees like this one that are only sold scooped out of bulk bins on location. For further information visit www.starbucks.com/roastery.","Who Should Drink It: Not your usual pungent, scorched-cedar Starbucks espresso blend. On the other hand, not a bright, crisply sweet lighter-roasted espresso in the newer style either. Unfortunately, short of traveling to Seattle and buying this blend in person at the new Starbucks Reserve Roastery readers apparently will have no way to decide for themselves whether Starbucks split the difference felicitously between dark and medium when it roasted this blend. The Starbucks Reserve coffees sold online or off-site are roasted much darker than this blend. Nice coffees, fancy names, but, well, just your same old dark-roasted Starbucks."

Although co-taster Ethan Hill (92) and Ken (92) gave this blend the same rating, Ken was a bit more enthusiastic than Ethan. Both agreed it was a crisply bright, floral-toned espresso (honeysuckle and gardenia for Ethan) with a light, silky mouthfeel. Ethan found a sweet corn undertone in the flavor, Ken a brown sugar note. Both were impressed by the flowers in the “refreshingly resonant” finish (Ethan). In three parts milk Ethan felt the floral brightness clashed a bit with the dairy, though the cup remained “quaintly drinkable”. Ken, on the other hand, felt the milk nicely softened and rounded the brisk, complex flowers.

Co-cupper Ethan Hill (92) and Ken (92) equally valued this espresso, but read it slightly differently. For Ethan it was a fundamentally sweet cup (“maple syrup”) with layered complexity: blackberry, chocolate, almond. For Ken a crisp, lively, slightly bitterish edge (roasted cacao nib, lavender) complicated the sweetness throughout. Both agreed that the mouthfeel was plump and syrupy. For Ethan the finish was sweet all the way; for Ken it was a touch drying. In three parts milk again Ethan emphasized the sweetness (“retained a nice marshmallow sweetness”) while Ken cited a brisk cocoa-and-lavender character. ","Notes: Ganesha Espresso is Tony’s flagship espresso blend. This current version is comprised of a dried-in-the-fruit or natural Yirgacheffe and two wet-processed or washed coffees, a Costa Rica La Macho and a Rwanda Gitesi.

Co-taster Ethan Hill (92) and Ken (92) ended with the same score for this blend though their descriptors varied rather dramatically. Ethan’s emphasized flowers and fruit, Ken’s sandalwood and nut, though both cited a fine, elegant dry cacao note.

A gentle tart character dominated in three-parts milk but pleasantly so, well-nuanced with cacao, cedar and orangy fruit.","Notes: This seasonal espresso blend consists of three distinctive origins: two wet-processed or washed coffees, a Colombia Amistad and a Rwanda Cotecaga, and a dried-in-the-fruit or natural-processed Brazil Recanto.

Exhilaratingly floral. For Ken (92) the flowers were explicit – rose, lily, lavender – whereas for co-taster Ethan Hill (92) the floral character was indirect, expressed in notes of peach, nectarine and coriander. Both valued a sweetly pungent sandalwood character enveloping the foreground floral/fruit notes, and both described the mouthfeel as silky but quite light and the finish bright and mildly drying. Flavor carried with perhaps surprising balance into three parts milk, softening while preserving a brisk floral-and-fruit complexity.

For both Ken (92) and co-taster Ethan Hill (91) high-toned floral notes and rather bright fruit (nectarine, strawberry) distinguished this complex blend. Very light but buoyant, almost effervescent mouthfeel. Along with fruit and flowers Ken identified a brisk roasted cacao-nib note that for him softened to chocolate in an otherwise rather drying finish. In three parts milk Ethan felt the floral character was muted and the acidity too assertive and out of balance; Ken, on the other hand, found the brisk cacao-and-flowers complex rather pleasing in milk.

Both co-taster Ethan Hill (92) and Ken (92) were impressed with deep, pungent aromatic wood notes (sandalwood, cedar) and rich fig and date suggestions. Ken found further complication: musky flowers and chocolate. Ethan felt that the low-toned richness turned rather barley-like in the finish, though for Ken it remained chocolaty.

Honey, distinct dark chocolate, lemon zest, peach, violet in aroma and cup. Richly and complexly expressed acidity; full, lightly syrupy mouthfeel. A mildly drying but long and resonant finish, with pleasing hints of the peach and violet persisting.","Notes: The unpredictability of coffee is confirmed once again with this striking sample, produced from trees that are apparently a spontaneous hybrid involving the famous Gesha (also Geisha) variety of Arabica. The producers Granja la Esperanza brought Gesha plant material from Panama, where this celebrated variety was first rediscovered, to Colombia, where they established it on their farm Cerro Azul. Some of the trees proved not to resemble the trees of the classic Gesha, however; they grew smaller and denser. The producers have given the name “Enano” or dwarf to this apparent hybrid of Gesha. Based on the slim evidence of the two samples of the Enano we have tested at Coffee Review, the result in the cup is a profile similar to the finest examples of bonafide Gesha, though perhaps a bit less intense in its Geshaness. Founded in 1995, Equator Coffees & Teas is a women-owned wholesale coffee roasting company with web-based retail and two recently-established cafés plus more on the way. Equator focuses on sustainability in coffee sourcing and business practices. Visit www.equatorcoffees.com or call 800-809-7687 for more information.","Who Should Drink It: Some may prefer this quieter version of the Gesha cup; still exotic and complex, but a bit more chocolate, fewer flowers, less forward acidity. And for a coffee this distinguished and this close in expression to the famous and rare Gesha, an excellent value: in other words, quite a bit of Geshaness for relatively little money."

The coffee comprising this sample is purportedly the progeny of a later importation of coffee seed to Indonesia in about 1928, supposedly directly from Ethiopia (previously Abyssinia). To our eye and palate, this coffee does not much resemble Ethiopian cultivars in bean shape or cup profile, though it is a subtly unusual cup, especially in respect to a lush, lily-like floral note. Like all traditional Sumatras, it is a wet-hulled coffee, which process most likely gives it its underlying cedary, bittersweet, pipe-tobacco-like character.

The richly and sweetly sourish sensation is most prominent in the acidity. Lightly syrupy, lively mouthfeel. In the aroma and flavor minty chocolate, lavender, a hint of strawberry, plum perhaps. The chocolate note carries into a very sweet, gently tart finish. We deducted one point from our original 91 rating owing to mildly uneven cups. ","Notes: In the 1990's a coffee-breeding program was initiated by the Hawaii Agricultural Research Center aimed at creating unique, truly Hawaiian coffee varieties. The Pohihiu variety that composes this sample, a hybrid of the exotic Mokka variety established in Maui and the mainstream Typica, is one of the outcomes from this breeding work. Very little of this variety was produced this crop year and Daylight Mind is one of only two roasters to present this unusual coffee from Oahu’s Waialua Estate. Daylight Mind’s co-founder, coffee scholar Shawn Steiman, has a long and close relationship with Waialua Estate. This sample consists entirely of peaberries, a kind of bean that results when the coffee fruit develops only a single, oval bean rather than the usual pair of flat-sided beans. Peaberries produce a somewhat different (often better) cup than normal beans from the same crop, from which they may or may not be separated during grading. Waialua Estate, located on the North Shore of the island of Oahu, is one of four mechanically harvested farms in Hawai‘i. Visit www.daylightmind.com or call 808.339.7824 for more information.","Who Should Drink It: Curious aficionados and those who value the quietly exotic. We puzzled over the odd sweet/sour/savory structure of this coffee when we cupped it blind. Such complications can be generated by serendipitous accidents of fruit removal and drying. We hope, however, that they are related to botanical variety, since this sample was produced from trees of a rare and unusual hybrid developed by Hawaii-based scientist Chifumi Nagai that combines the distinctive-tasting Mokka variety, probably originally from Yemen or Ethiopia via Brazil, and a sturdy local strain of the classic Typica."

The producers Granja la Esperanza brought Gesha plant material from Panama, where this celebrated variety was first rediscovered, to Colombia, where they established it on their farm Cerro Azul. Some of the trees proved not to resemble the trees of the classic Gesha, however; they grew smaller and denser. The producers have given the name “Enano” or dwarf to this apparent hybrid of Gesha. Based on the slim evidence of this single sample of the Enano, the result in the cup is a profile similar to the finest examples of bonafide Gesha, though perhaps a bit less intense in its Geshaness.

Balanced, smoothly complete coffee: the raisiny fruit and cedary dark chocolate in the aroma sweetens toward fresh cherry and milk chocolate in the cup, with a tart complication of lemon. Sweetly tart, citrus-toned acidity; very smooth, silky mouthfeel. Flavor simplifies a bit in the clean finish.","Notes: Doi Chaang is a single-estate coffee produced by a northern Thailand hill tribe in the Golden Triangle mountains of Thailand and roasted in Alberta, Canada. The independent coffee growers receive over 50% of the profits of this unusual and pioneering venture. In addition to its excellent conventional arabica coffees, the cooperative members harvest small quantities of two versions of the famous (or infamous) kopi luwak, the world’s most expensive coffee, the beans of which are “processed” by a species of wild civet that eats ripe coffee fruit. The version reviewed here is comprised of beans that they have swallowed along with the fruit, and which are harvested from their feces.

The combination of tart lemon and raisiny chocolate is a bit unusual in the sensory world of coffee, however, and here quite attractive."
