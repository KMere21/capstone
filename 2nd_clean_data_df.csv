Doi Chaang Wild Civet Coffee,Doi Chaang Coffee,90,"Calgary, Alberta, Canada","Blind Assessment: Intriguing mid-tones throughout the profile: mainly a sort of orangy, floral citrus with a backgrounded complex simultaneously suggesting fresh earth, mushroom and decomposing leaves. All of this takes on a vaguely chocolaty tone in the finish. Gently smooth acidity, medium body.","Notes: Doi Chaang is a single-estate coffee produced by a northern Thailand hill tribe in the Golden Triangle mountains of Thailand and roasted in Alberta, Canada. The independent coffee growers receive over 50% of the profits of this unusual and pioneering venture. In addition to its excellent conventional arabica coffees, the cooperative members harvest about 200 pounds per year of a Thai version of the famous (or infamous) kopi luwak, the world's most expensive coffee, the beans of which are harvested from the feces of a species of wild civet that eats ripe coffee fruit.

Kenya AA Lenana,Après Coffee,92,"Lancaster, Pennsylvania","Blind Assessment: Rich, very intense aroma: dark chocolate, aromatic wood, nut, hints of citrus: orange, tangerine. The cup is influenced by a moderately dark roast, which nicely rounds acidity and turns the celebrated Kenya dry berry notes toward a crisply sweet cocoa or dark chocolate, with a continued shimmer of citrus. The berry-toned chocolate carries into a simple, rich finish. The only limitation of this graceful coffee is a lean, almost thin mouthfeel, though that could be admired as another expression of its complex delicacy.","Notes: Despite stresses brought on by social unrest, charges of corruption and a confused transition toward an open market, the famed Kenya coffee auction system and its participating cooperatives continue to produce some of the world's most elegant and distinctive coffees.

Who’s Yer Daddy Espresso,Redeye Roasters,91,"Hingham, Massachusetts","Blind Assessment: For Ken (90) this blend led with the fruity ferment of dried-in-the-fruit coffee, and his assessments reflect his ambivalence toward the type; he read chocolate and an attractive brandyish fruit in the aroma and flavor, but was bothered by a slight, shadow hint of salt.  Byron (92) on the other hand read almost all positives in the fruity richness: ""dark and spicy flavors blended to a round, sweet, nutty finish that left a post-ice-cream mouthfeel.

Italian Espresso Blend,Moksha Coffee Roasting,91,"Mountain View, California","Blind Assessment: Ken (92) enjoyed this espresso considerably more than did co-taster Byron Holcomb (89). The reason may have been their differing reactions to the influence of a fruity fermented character that Ken read as pleasingly brandy-like and Byron as dry white wine at best, bitterish seed-and-skin, muscadine grape at worst. Similarly, Ken was more positive toward a fresh-cut cedar character in aroma and flavor. Ken did have reservations about finish, where a hint of the heavy, salty side of the fruit ferment showed up. Byron gave the blend a break in four parts milk, where he described its impact as ""white grape juice, subtle but nice, clean.""

The Boss Espresso,Barefoot Coffee Roasters,91,"Santa Clara, California","Blind Assessment: Very complex espresso in which forceful blend components were allowed full, if rather competitive expression. Co-taster Byron Holcomb (90) read the earthy and mildly musty side of the blend: earth and molasses in the aroma, ""musty, cedar - a little confused"" in the small cup. Ken (92) on the other hand, read the confusion as complexity and emphasized the Ethiopian elements, particularly the flowers and fruit, which for him gave the cedar and earth tendencies an anise-like liveliness. Both admired the mouthfeel, which Byron described as ""the same weight as whole milk: buttery and round without heaviness."" Impressive in four parts milk: ""deeply, richly and cleanly chocolaty"" for Ken; toffee-like for Byron, though his reservation persisted: ""still a bit dirty.""

Both Ken (90) and Byron enjoyed the lightly syrupy, cohesive mouthfeel. Both offered approving descriptors for an unusual flavor complex that Byron described as dry flowers and Ken as anise and herb.

Espresso 700 Competition Blend,Kaldi's Coffee Roasting,92,"St. Louis, Missouri","Blind Assessment: The heavily syrupy body of this espresso particularly impressed both Ken (90) and co-taster Byron Holcomb (93) who for his part associated it with the fruity heaviness of mango nectar. The tropical fruit theme also surfaced in Ken's description of flavor and finish, where he found ""bananaish fruit"" along with cedar and anise. Byron also admired the ""subtle, nutty, light nose"" that turned to honey and whiskey in his characterization of flavor.

(for Single-Origin) is Paradise Roaster's designation for its line of espressos based on green coffees from distinguished single growing regions.

They split the difference in the finish: the short finish belongs to the fruit and chocolate, the long to the dry, herby mouthfeel.","Notes: A region of lush, rolling hills in south-central Ethiopia, Yirgacheffe is most celebrated for its washed or wet-processed coffee, meaning coffee that has been prepared by removing the fruit before the beans or seeds have been dried, resulting in a cleanly high-toned, intensely floral- and citrus-toned cup. The Yirgacheffe reviewed here, however, is a ""natural"" or dry-processed version of the great Yirgacheffe profile, meaning the beans/seeds were dried inside the fruit, producing a flavor profile that is lower toned and richer with a wild, slightly fermented fruit.

Espresso (T Disc),Gevalia Kaffe,83,"Gavle, Sweden","Blind Assessment: Evaluated based on a one-ounce shot produced from a T Disc capsule on a matching Tassimo TAS451xUC brewing device. Sweet, faintly fruit- and chocolate-toned aroma. Thinnish body and mouthfeel, softly pungent flavor with vague, subdued fruit notes. The flavor fades very quickly in the finish to a rather stolid heaviness. In two parts hot, fresh milk, displays a roundly pungent chocolate suggestion with an edge that could read as smoky. Combining this disc with the contents of the matching Gevalia Latte milk disc (and allowing both to respond to the bar-coded instructions incorporated on the discs) netted a rather dilute beverage, sweet and distinctly chocolate- and nut-toned but thin-bodied with a faint metallic shadow.","Notes: The Tassimo system, with its new Bosch-manufactured brewing device and match proprietary T Discs, aims at providing a convenience-first single-serving solution for a variety of beverages, including filter-style coffee, tea, espresso-based beverages and hot chocolate.

The overall versatility of the system is impressive, and the Tassimo makes a fair ""long-black"" style Northern European cup, but we found the Tassimo and its T Discs produced rather listless espresso when we brewed a classic one-ounce serving using the manual override button to interrupt the bar-coded instructions on the T Discs.

In the small cup lightly syrupy mouthfeel with continued fruity chocolate notes anchored by a hint of aromatic wood. A rich short finish fades rather quickly to woody sweetness. A little overpowered by two parts milk, but impressive in body and flavor: more chocolate and aromatic wood and a reappearance of the tropical fruit and floral notes that last displayed early on in the aroma.","Notes: The IllyCaffe iperEspresso espresso system brews from proprietary plastic capsules matched to a dedicated version (X7) of the FrancisFrancis! machine. The system is technically very sophisticated, including a pre-infusion cycle on the brewer and a crema-promoting capsule design consisting of, by our count, seven different components.

Tartly sweet acidity, full, juicy mouthfeel. The cup suggests penetrating flavors of honey-sweetened lemonade and lavender. Mild sweetness in the finish, with a very slight astringency.","Notes: Finca Los Planes is a distinguished, innovating El Salvador farm, one of whose coffees placed second in the 2006 El Salvador Cup of Excellence competition. Produced from trees of the Pacamara variety at an elevation of approximately 5,300 feet by farmer Sergio Edmundo Ticas Reyes on the Los Planes farm. The Pacamara variety, a cross between the giant-beaned Maragogipe variety and Pacas, a selection of the heirloom Bourbon, has proven to produce exceptional coffee on many El Salvador farms. This selection consists entirely of peaberries, a kind of bean that results when the coffee fruit develops only a single, oval bean rather than the usual pair of flat-sided beans. Peaberries produce a somewhat different (often better) cup than normal beans from the same crop, from which they may or may not be separated during grading. This peaberry was tactfully roasted at PT's Coffee, where the motto is ""without the love, it's just coffee.""

Offering everything from baked goods to frozen foods, Archer Farms is a premium-food house brand of the Target Corporation. This coffee is available exclusively at Target stores in a very handsome, reusable 10-ounce tin. Selling an exclusive competition-winning coffee in a mass-marketing context is something new in the coffee world. The price, $14.99 for 10 ounces, may appear to contradict the second half of the Archer Farms motto, ""Tasty Food Tasty Price."" On the other hand, the wholesale price for this coffee bought unroasted at auction was over $20 per pound as listed on the Cup of Excellence website.

Ethiopia Misty Valley,Olympia Coffee Roasting,89,"Olympia, Washington","Blind Assessment: A richly sweet, almost overripe, berry-like aroma, with hints of earthiness. Full and smooth mouthfeel with soft, moderately sweet acidity. Though not quite as intense as in the aroma, the berry notes carry into the cup, joining a fruit-toned chocolate note that can be found in cocoa nibs. The long, dry, baker's chocolate finish turns slightly bitter as the coffee cools.","Notes: A region of lush, rolling hills in south-central Ethiopia, Yirgacheffe is the most celebrated of Ethiopia's coffee-growing regions. Most Yirgacheffe coffees are processed by the wet or washed method, meaning the fruit is removed from the beans or seeds before they are dried, emphasizing the cleanly high-toned, intensely floral-and citrus-toned aspects of the Yirgacheffe cup. The Yirgacheffe reviewed here, however, is a ""natural"" or dry-processed version of the great Yirgacheffe profile, meaning the beans/seeds were dried inside the fruit, producing a flavor profile that is lower toned and richer with a giddy, wild, slightly fermented fruit. Like most Ethiopia coffees, this certified organically grown coffee is produced by villagers on small, garden plots interplanted with food and other subsistence crops.

Original Premium Coffee,Yuban,81,"Northfield, Illinois","Blind Assessment: An easy cup to describe but a difficult one to rate, given that canned blends of this kind are hardly coffee at all in the traditional understanding of the term, rather another kind of beverage altogether: no acidity or brightness, sweet but woody, with an herby, peppery pungency and a molasses note that aspires to chocolate but doesn't quite make it past the wood and herb. Smoothes out in a neutral but pleasantly sweet finish. We gave it the benefit of the doubt at 81.","Notes: This inexpensive coffee blend is Rainforest Alliance certified, meaning a minimum of 30% of the blend components were produced following sustainable ecological and socio-economic criteria developed by the Sustainable Agricultural Network, a coalition of independent, environment-focused non-governmental organizations.

But for both the mouthfeel was a bit lean in the small cup and the flavor a bit sharp, though Ken admired the continued floral notes. For both tasters the profile smoothed in the long finish, with a sweet flavor persistence that suggested chocolate for Ken, ""blackberry pie"" for Heather. Heather found it lost sweetness in milk but Ken was pleased, finding it crisp with ""true chocolate"" notes.","Notes: Certified Fair Trade, meaning coffee purchased from small-holding farmers at a ""fair"" or economically sustainable price. Ghimbi (also spelled Gimbi) is a principal town and also an Ethiopian market name for a mainly dry-processed coffee from the Wollega region.

Fazenda Sao Joao Brasil,Ritual Coffee Roasters,92,"San Francisco, California","Blind Assessment: Little difference in rating or description between Ken (92) and co-cupper Ted Stachura (91) in regard to this exceptional Brazil natural. Ted's assessment: ""Big, floral aroma - lavender, fruit and sweet-leaning white wine. Floral and fruit qualities carry into the bright, yet fine, acidity. Complex flavors with more floral upfront, subtle, tart citrus tones and lots of sweetness. Clean finish with lingering floral hints.""","Notes: Processed by the traditional Brazilian natural or dry method, meaning the beans were dried with both skin and fruit still adhering to the bean. A semi-arid climate prevailing during harvest apparently permits farmer Reginaldo Silvoni to achieve a purity of profile, free of fermented sugars or mildew, despite the relatively lengthy drying period occasioned by drying coffee inside the tough fruit skin.

Fazenda do Serrado Brasil,Ritual Coffee Roasters,91,"San Francisco, California","Blind Assessment: Ken (91) was struck by the pungently sweet berry or black currant notes, which carry straight through from aroma through cup to finish. Co-cupper Ted Stachura (also 91) was a bit more general in his characterization, finding ""sweet, winy tones and fruit"" in the aroma and ""bright acidity with floral qualities and sweet tangerine, cherry blossom and chocolate"" in the cup. For both Ken and Ted the finish was slightly heavy but nevertheless pleasantly rich and flavor-saturated.","Notes: Processed by the pulped natural method, meaning the skin is removed from the coffee fruit immediately after picking, but the seeds or beans are dried with the sweet pulp, or fruit flesh, still adhering to them. From trees of the Yellow Bourbon variety. Bourbon is a prestigious, heirloom variety of Coffea Arabica; this particular strain has a yellow skin. The Bourbon character, a sort of sweetly dry berry note often described as black currant, is quite prominent in this coffee. From the Carmo de Minas growing region, an area relatively high in altitude and cool in climate, which may account for this coffee's bright, complex acidity. Fazenda do Serrado is Brazilian farm celebrated for having placed in the Brazil Cup of Excellence green coffee competition three separate years.

In the cup softly acidy, gently bittersweet, quietly complex: cocoa, roasted nut, (walnut for Ted), hints of flowers, citrus and plumy fruit. The cocoa turns chocolaty in a surprisingly rich finish.","Notes: Processed by the pulped natural method, meaning the skin is removed from the coffee fruit immediately after picking, but the seeds or beans are dried with the sweet pulp, or fruit flesh, still adhering to them.

Organic Fair-Trade Mocha Java,Green Mountain Coffee,88,"Waterbury, Vermont","Blind Assessment: Deep-toned and roasty in the aroma: dark chocolate, fir, floral top notes. In the cup heavy bodied, low-toned, continued dark chocolate and aromatic wood notes with the barest hint of flowers at the top. Smooths out nicely in the finish: rich, sweet, chocolaty.","Notes: Coffees in this blend are certified organically grown and Fair Trade, meaning they were purchased from small-holding farmers at a ""fair"" or economically sustainable price. Mocha Java is the world's earliest blend, originally combining acidy, fruity, dry-processed coffee from southern Arabia (now Yemen) shipped through the port of Mocha with fuller-bodied, lower-toned, wet-processed coffee from Java. Contemporary versions often replace the Yemen and Java with very similar cupping coffees from Ethiopia and Sumatra.

The cocoa turns toward chocolate in the long, rich finish.","Notes: El Conquistador is essentially a brand of green coffee associated with a particularly high-altitude portion of the famous Tarrazu growing region and with certain picking and processing nuances (riper fruit, perhaps longer fermentation) that arguably also affect its cup character along with its high-altitude terroir.

Soft, muted acidity in the cup, medium body, with a very sweet, molasses-toned character balanced by the walnut-like crispness of the pervasive cocoa notes. Continued hints of flowers. Short but nicely flavor saturated finish.","Notes: Produced from a newly developed hybrid variety of tree that produces coffee with about half as much caffeine as is contained in beans from typical varieties of Coffea Arabica (and one-quarter as much as contained in most robusta coffee).

Yemen Mocca Sanani,Victrola Coffee Roasters,89,"Seattle, Washington","Blind Assessment: Janus-like coffee: sweet, rich, and lushly fruity with an herby bitter note that, depending on taste, either complicates or shadows the main event of the fruit. In the aroma the lushly fermented fruit reads as rich, cherryish chocolate with a hint of flowers and pungent cedar. In the cup gently acidy, medium bodied, crisply sweet with continued cherry- and chocolate-toned fruit and the bitterish rosemary note. Sweetness and chocolate prevail in the surprisingly clean finish.","Notes: Coffee as a commercial enterprise almost certainly started in Yemen, at the mountainous southwestern tip of the Arabian Peninsula, from seed originally brought across the Red Sea from Ethiopia. Amazingly, coffee is still produced in Yemen almost exactly as it was in the seventeenth century: picked, put out on roofs of stone houses to dry, hulled by millstone and winnowed by hand. Unfortunately, the quality of this once magnificent coffee has declined, probably owing to competition from qat, a tree that grows in conditions similar to coffee but produces a more lucrative year-round crop for farmers: the tender fresh leaves are gathered daily and taken as a mild stimulant that grows in power as the ball of qat is held in the mouth for hours in the afternoon. Mocca is an allusion to the traditional name for Yemen coffee, Mocca or Mocha after the original port through which it was once shipped, Al Makha. Sanani is a locally blended type made up of coffee from several traditional growing regions west of the capital city of Sana'a.

In the cup roast-muted acidity, substantial mouthfeel, and a crisp, dense baker's chocolate character with continued hints of molasses, nut and flowers. Simple but richly deep finish.","Notes: A Peet's ""Reserve"" coffee. The JR in the blend name is a reference to the blend's creator, Peet's longtime green buyer and coffee guru Jim Reynolds. (Jim observes: ""After thirty years you get a Peet's blend named after you."") Originally founded by the late Alfred Peet, one of American specialty coffee's pioneers, Peet's is now a publicly traded corporation that so far has managed to maintain its essential identity during a slow, careful expansion from its intensely loyalist base in the San Francisco Bay area.

Mocha Java Light Roast,Green Mountain Coffee,89,"Waterbury, Vermont","Blind Assessment: Delicate, gently exotic, complex profile: faintly smoky in aroma and cup, with cocoa, cedar, floral and caramel notes. Lightly syrupy in mouthfeel and bittersweet in structure. The short finish is sweetly cocoa-toned; the long gently astringent.","Notes: Mocha Java is the world's oldest blend, traditionally combining a fruity, high-grown dry-processed coffee from Yemen (originally shipped through the port of Mocha or Al Makha in southwest Arabia) with a gentler, somewhat lower-grown wet-processed coffee from Java.

But despite having been created out of exigency, the Mocha-Java blend has proven to be attractive to 250 years of coffee drinkers, and is widely offered today, although the Yemen component is often replaced by a similar dry-processed coffee from the Harrar region of Ethiopia.

At its best in milk: rich, strong-presenced but sweet with dark chocolate and sustained suggestions of moist earth and flowers.","Notes: Lintong is the traditional market name for an admired coffee type grown near Lake Toba in north-central Sumatra.

Rwandan French Roast,Kirkland Signature (Costco),80,"Seattle, Washington","Blind Assessment: Decent but flawed ultra-dark-roast. Begins well: Roundly and gently charred in the aroma with hints of dark chocolate and butter. In the cup medium body and a simple but richly, buttery charred character with a continued slight suggestion of chocolate. A rather rich astringency in the short finish grows more insistent in the long. As the cup cools the hints of chocolate regrettably give way to hints of rubber.","Notes: French Roast is the standard name in North America for a coffee that has been brought to an extreme dark roast that mutes the characteristics of the green coffee itself and foregrounds the pungent flavor of the roast. Rwanda is now producing coffees that rank among the world's finest, but given the extreme dark roast to which this Rwanda has been subjected it is difficult to determine anything whatsoever about the character of the green coffee.

Kopi Luwak Robusta Dark Roast,Animalcoffee,84,"Keperra, Queensland, Australia","Blind Assessment: Evaluated as espresso. As a drip coffee fell quite short of 80. As espresso revealed some virtues. In the aroma sweet-toned with distinct chocolate and butter notes. In the small cup medium bodied, round-toned and sweet, with earth, aromatic wood and herbal notes (I read fennel) and hints of nut and chocolate.

El Salvador Cerreo Las Ranas,Coffee Bean Direct,90,"Titusville, New Jersey","Blind Assessment: A very light-roasted, naturally sweet coffee that stays just on the rich side of raw.

In the cup soft acidity with a shimmer of wine, substantial body, continued sweet raw nut notes with hints of butter, chocolate and flowers. Rich, long, slightly heavy finish.","Notes: This coffee?s low-acid, naturally sweet character is in part owing to a fruit-removal method unusual for Central America, the pulped natural method, meaning the skin but not the fruit flesh was removed from the beans before they were dried.

Yemen Mocha,Batdorf & Bronson,87,"Olympia, Washington","Blind Assessment: Ambiguous flavors associated with fruity mustiness run through the profile. Co-cupper Miguel Meza (87) describes them as: ""Sweet-smoky and medicinal. A pungent and musty full-bodied coffee with exotic hints of eucalyptus, sassafras and bakers' yeast.""  Ken (86) is more conventional and more positive: ""Rich, raisiny dark chocolate with a pungent cedar and herbal edge in aroma and rather syrupy cup.""","Notes: A dry-processed or ""natural"" coffee, meaning the beans were dried inside the fruit rather than after the fruit has been removed, as is the case with wet-processed or ""washed"" coffees. Although Ethiopia is the botanical home of Coffea arabica, Yemen introduced the beverage to the rest of the world in the 16th and 17th centuries. Amazingly, little has changed in the Yemeni coffee industry since then; coffee is still grown from ancient cultivars, sun-dried on the roofs of stone houses and hulled by millstone.

In the cup rich red-wine-toned acidity, silky mouthfeel, deep and balanced structure with a cherryish fruit and a continued hint of chocolate. Simple, rich, sweet finish.","Notes: Most coffee from Ethiopia's Yirgacheffe region is prepared by removing the fruit from the beans or seeds before they are dried (wet-processing), producing a cleanly high-toned, often intensely floral- and citrus-toned cup. This Yirgacheffe appears to be a ""natural"" or dry-processed version, however, meaning the beans/seeds were dried inside the fruit, producing a flavor profile that is lower-toned with a deeper, wine-and berry-like fruit.

Ethiopian Shanta Golba Natural Sidamo,Green Mountain Coffee,88,"Waterbury, Vermont","Blind Assessment: In the aroma deep, sweet, with exhilarating floral top notes and a fruit ferment that reads persuasively as raisiny chocolate with a hint of cedar. In the full-bodied cup the dark, raisin-toned chocolate and the floral notes sustain, while the pungent tendencies in the aroma intensify, contributing a cedary, herby, rather salty character to the profile. The fine aromatics regain the upper hand in the floral- and chocolate-toned finish.","Notes: The unusual character of this coffee derives from two sources: botany and processing. The older, traditional Ethiopian varieties of arabica that produce coffees like this one introduce a fruit and floral character to the cup. And in the case of this coffee, the fruit notes are given a fermented nuance owing to the processing method, the dry or ""natural"" method, in which the beans are dried inside the coffee fruit rather than after the fruit has been removed. Fermenting of fruit sugars during the lengthy drying period of such ""natural"" coffees is not inevitable, but typical in regions like Sidamo with relatively humid conditions during drying.

Simple but long, honeyed finish.","Notes: Ka'u is a newly emerging Hawaii coffee growing district centered 30 miles or so south of the famous Kona region. This particular coffee, from the 7-acre Will and Grace Tabios farm, recently put a shot across the bow of its celebrated neighbor by placing 6th in the 2007 Specialty Coffee Association of America's Roasters Guild Cupping Pavilion Competition. With fruit removal and drying performed using traditional artisan methods increasingly abandoned by the larger Kona mills, bold beans and a big, sweet, classic cup, this particular Ka'u certainly rivals the best of any Kona I have cupped.

Sumatra (Beveo),Beveo Coffee & Tea,88,Scottsdale Arizona,"Blind Assessment: (As produced in a Beveo concentrate coffee machine at the setting netting the second to ""strongest"" ratio of coffee concentrate to water): Very sweet-toned, caramelly aroma with hints of butter, earth and green apple. In the cup smooth mouthfeel and simple but agreeable flavor dominated by very sweet but pungent fruit notes - think dried pear or apple rather than fresh. Sweet, rich, gently tart finish.","Notes: The Beveo Coffee & Tea program is built around a machine that produces coffees and teas from sophisticated liquid concentrates at the touch of a button. The company currently offers four coffees (this Sumatra is the latest) and two tea choices in 16-serving ""beveos"" or pouches. The beveos can be switched in and out of the machine at will in a few seconds, and serving size, brew strength and water temperature are adjustable within a wide range. The concentrate coffees are brewed from high quality specialty beans with some standard preservatives added after brewing. Aside from the implied advantage in convenience, the concentrate method tends to produce a characteristic style of cup - silky in mouthfeel and sweet and caramelly in basic structure - that fundamentally differs from a typical brewed coffee profile, but may appeal to many coffee drinkers on its own terms. The traditional Sumatra character - pungently earthy and fruity - does manage to make itself felt here, if rather sweetly and quietly.

This time around I was impressed by the purity of the aroma and its floral, apple, lemon and milk chocolate notes. The mouthfeel certainly is not fat, but could be praised as silky. The cup could be criticized as a bit too sharp and simple, or valued (as I did) for its gentle tartness and hints of cedar, flowers and lemon. The finish could be praised for its floral and fruit persistence or criticized for a slight lean toward astringency.

Ethiopia Natural Yirgacheffe Aricha Special Microlot,Paradise Roasters,95,"Ramsey, Minnesota","Blind Assessment: Intense aroma: nut, mint, brandied cherry chocolate. In the cup rich acidity, silky body and a continuing aromatic profile so deeply and explosively complex that a world of coffee sensation can be found in it: cocoaish chocolate, raisin, flowers, lemon, brandy, orange peel. Very sweet and flavor-saturated short finish, though in the long a very slight salty astringency shadows the fine aromatic echoes.","Notes: Most Yirgacheffe coffee is prepared by removing the fruit before the beans or seeds have been dried, producing a cleanly high-toned, often intensely floral- and citrus-toned cup. This Ethiopia is a ""natural"" or dry-processed version, however, meaning the beans/seeds were dried inside the fruit, producing a flavor profile that is lower-toned with a deep, wine-and berry-like fruit. Like virtually all Ethiopia coffees, this striking and unusual coffee is produced by villagers on small, garden plots interplanted with food and other subsistence crops.

Aged Sumatra Lintong Vintage 2004,Paradise Roasters,92,"Ramsey, Minnesota","Blind Assessment: A superb example of its type, though not a coffee for the conventional. Wood and musty earth notes in the aroma are enriched by butter and orange that together read persuasively as a sort of butterscotch. Rather lean-bodied but very sweet in the cup with orange, pipe tobacco and continued butterscotch notes. In the finish suddenly blossoms and soars, with altogether new and surprising chocolate and even some giddy floral notes.","Notes: Lintong is the most admired regional coffee type of Sumatra.

Papua New Guinea Kunjun Estate,Paradise Roasters,90,"Ramsey, Minnesota","Blind Assessment: Lushly complex aroma: flowers, honey, molasses and sweetly tart fruit notes that suggest grapefruit. In the cup moderate in acidity, medium in body, with an opulent candyish, molasses-toned floral character and continued tart fruit notes enriched by a slight, brandy-like ferment. Clean, rich finish. The cup flattens very slightly as it cools.","Notes: The high mountain valleys of central Papua New Guinea, the nation that occupies the eastern half of the giant island of New Guinea, offer superb growing conditions for Coffea arabica. Despite the wine-toned ""estate"" in the name, this coffee is probably a ""native"" Papua New Guinea coffee, meaning it was grown and prepared for market by villagers using the simplest of fruit removal procedures. These procedures most likely account for the lovely sweet fruit ferment tones that gently complicate the pure structure of this high-grown coffee.

Aricha Selection Seven Ethiopia Yirgacheffe,Novo Coffee,95,"Denver, Colorado","Blind Assessment: No hints here: The aromatics are direct, inescapable, lavish. Lushly intense blueberry, chocolate, and floral-toned honey in the aroma. In the cup the incendiary aromatics are influenced by a wine-like acidity that turns the berry and chocolate notes crisp and richly dry. The fundamental berry and floral notes linger with surprising clarity in the finish, although they are outlasted by a slight but forgivable astringency.","Notes: Most southern Ethiopia coffee is prepared by removing the fruit from the beans or seeds before they are dried (wet-processing), which produces a cleanly high-toned, often intensely floral- and citrus-toned cup. This southern Ethiopia is a ""natural"" or dry-processed version, however, meaning the beans/seeds were dried inside the fruit, producing a flavor profile that is lower-toned with a deep, wine-and berry-like fruit.

The pungent cedar notes intensify in the small cup, supported by a deep, enveloping sweetness and viscosity. Here the syrupy honey and banana notes are more felt than tasted, and segue into an impressively long, cleanly resonant finish. In milk the cedar and fruit tighten and simplify somewhat, reading as a crisp semi-sweet chocolate.",Notes: Paradise Roasters prides itself on roasting and shipping coffee only after orders are placed.

In the cup sweetly acidy, with a full, syrupy mouthfeel and lavish red wine and blueberry notes. The finish is rich, berry-toned and extraordinarily clean for this style of coffee.","Notes: Most southern Ethiopia coffee is prepared by removing the fruit before the beans or seeds have been dried, producing a cleanly high-toned, often intensely floral- and citrus-toned cup. This Ethiopia is a ""natural"" or dry-processed version, however, meaning the beans/seeds were dried inside the fruit, producing a flavor profile that is lower-toned with a deep, wine-and berry-like fruit.

Simply Smooth,Folgers,78,"Cincinnati, Ohio","Blind Assessment: Sweet, simple aroma dominated by walnut and neutral wood notes. In the cup lean in mouthfeel with some raisiny fruit in front, but the main sensation is salty wood - think licking driftwood. The salty/sweet theme continues in the finish, though the fruit hangs on, an agreeably soft banana-like sensation. It's difficult to assign a rating to such an oddly woody, lifeless beverage; but it does show sweetness and a little agreeable fruit, hence the 78 as opposed to, say, 60, or 50, or 0.","Notes: A pre-ground supermarket brand launched in 2007, Simply Smooth describes itself as ""Gentle on Your Stomach."" The process used to reduce acidity apparently happens during the roasting; perhaps simply involving a very slow roast, a common strategy used to reduce acidity.

Regular Gourmet Low Acid Coffee,Hevla Coffee Company,83,"Endicott, New York","Blind Assessment: Sweet, woody, simple aroma: perhaps some pipe tobacco and lemon notes. In the cup definitely mild in acidity with a caramelly sweetness, but all suggestions of normal coffee aromatics vanish, with the main sensation a neutral woodiness that carries from cup into a sweet but rather empty finish.","Notes: This arabica coffee has been treated to reduce acids and the acidy sensation that may create gastric discomfort in some people. The procedure is applied to the coffee in its green state, before roasting. The reduction of acids is combined here with a relatively dark roast style, which contrasts with the very light, Northern-European roast style applied to coffees treated by a similar method by JJ Darboven.

House Blend,Puroast,84,"Woodland, California","Blind Assessment: Simple, gently roasty aroma: toasted bread, lightly charred cedar, hints of cardamom and dried fruit, dried cherries perhaps. In the cup leanish mouthfeel with good sweetness but rather flat and simple, with continued charred cedar and perhaps some walnut notes. The nut notes dominate in the short finish; the long finish is sweet but slightly astringent.","Notes: Evaluated pre-ground. Puroast claims that its extremely slow roasting process in a sealed drum results in (in the case of this coffee) ""50% lower acidity"" producing a ""Stomach Friendly Coffee."" ""Feel better not bitter,"" reads the trade-marked slogan. The website suggests that the 50% figure is based on measurements of quinic acid, a substance created by the transformation of chlorogenic acids during roasting, and associated with bitter and sour sensations.

In the cup medium bodied, with continued sweet nut, prune and carob notes together with agreeably persistent floral nuance. As the cup cools and the aromatics begin to fade a woody, albeit a richly woody, character emerges. Sweet, short finish with a slight, gentle astringency.","Notes: Evaluated pre-ground. This arabica coffee has been treated to reduce acids and the acidy sensation that may create gastric discomfort in some people. The patented procedure is applied to the coffee in its green state, before roasting.

Sumatra Mandheling,Wood-Fire Roasted Coffee,88,"Reno, Nevada","Blind Assessment: Intense aroma in a narrow range: pungent rosemary-like herb notes, an orangy citrus, and some slightly charred wood notes. In the cup lean-bodied but forceful, dominated by a grapefruity pungency with a slight charred edge that with imagination reads as a semi-sweet chocolate. The chocolate is explicit, however, in the impressively sweet, long finish.","Notes: Mandheling is the traditional market name for an admired coffee type grown in the region around Lake Toba in north-central Sumatra. These coffees are marked by low acidity and idiosyncratic flavor notes that appear to result from serendipitous taints - mild ferment and mildew - acquired during unconventional drying procedures. The Wood-Fire Roasted Coffee Company roasts, of course, on a machine that uses oak wood as a heat source, which means its coffees are slow roasted, an approach that tends to reduce the sharper kinds of acidity.

Espresso Blend Extra Bold K-Cup,Green Mountain Coffee,86,"Waterbury, Vermont","Blind Assessment: (As brewed in a Keurig B60 single-serve brewing device using a ""K-Cup"" capsule to produce 6-ounce and 8-ounce serving sizes): Considerably more impressive in a 6-ounce serving size than in an 8.

Panama Esmeralda Especial,Stumptown Coffee Roasters,95,"Portland, Oregon","Blind Assessment: Spectacularly aromatic in both dry and infused aroma: candied lemon peel, bergamot, hints of jasmine. Medium bodied and sweet, with superb acidity and flavors that suggest both the mentholated citrus of a Yirgacheffe and the blueberry notes of a Harrar, but without a trace of ferment or earthiness.

El Salvador Pacamara Los Planes,Intelligentsia Coffee,95,"Chicago, Illinois","Blind Assessment: Cocoa laced with citrus in the aroma. Flavors are as complex and sculpted as a top Alsatian Riesling, with intense lemon and orange acidity, chocolate, and a suggestion of fresh chive or tarragon always associated with this variety.  A powerful, aristocratic grand cru. This fragile, low-density variety is a major challenge to roast (and cannot handle dark roasting); this is a particularly masterful roasting job.","Notes: A prize winner in the 2006 El Salvador Cup of Excellence competition, where as a green (unroasted) coffee it placed second out of hundreds of entries, attracting a score of 93.52 from an international jury.

Original Christmas,Klatch Coffee,90,"San Dimas, California","Blind Assessment: An exhilarating and intense blueberry and wine character dominates the profile from aroma to finish. In the aroma the blueberry and wine tones are particularly pure and sweet. In the cup things grow more complicated: the blueberry takes a chocolate turn and the wine may strike some palates as too aggressively fermented. The finish is even more ambiguous, as the blueberry fruit persists nicely but takes a slightly soapy, salty direction.

Excellent flavor persistence in the long, complex finish.","Notes: From the recently established Tega and Tulla farm in Kefa (traditionally Anglicized as Kaffa) Province. Kefa/Kaffa is reputed to be the botanical birthplace of Coffea arabica, the species that until the 20th century produced all of the world's commercially traded coffees and still produces all of the great ones. Whether this particular Kaffa coffee owes its character to coffee types that go back to the beginning of coffee history may be difficult to confirm, but for certain this particular lot is subtly but distinctly different from any other coffee type I have ever cupped. Although I need to add a caveat: another lot from the same farm I cupped last year was not nearly as distinctive.

The cocoa/carob notes persist in the long, sweetly pleasant finish. Very slight astringency.","Notes: This arabica coffee has been treated to reduce acids and the acidy sensation that creates gastric discomfort in some people. The patented procedure is applied to the coffee in its green state, before roasting.

As with the finest dry-processed coffees from Ethiopia, the fruit fermented slightly and sweetly during drying, contributing a wild but elegant chocolate-blueberry character.

Black Flag Espresso,Island Joe's Coffee,90,"Key West, Florida","Blind Assessment: Cocoa, banana and a hint of cedar in the fine aroma. In the small cup big-bodied, gently and sweetly pungent, with a rich, orange-toned cedar character and cocoa notes that round toward chocolate. Rich short finish, very slightly astringent in the long, but sweet chocolate suggestions persist throughout. Remains in sturdy control in milk, though it never quite sweetens and blossoms.",Notes: Joe Wells started his small-batch roasting business in a gas station because no one else in his part of the Florida Keys sold fresh-roasted coffee.

Black Apron Exclusive Kopi Kampung Sulawesi,Starbucks Coffee,86,"Seattle, Washington","Blind Assessment: Hints of banana-toned fruit, chocolate, fresh-baked bread in the complex but rather listless aroma. Thin though silky mouthfeel. Pungent, gently burned cedar character in the cup, with floral and caramelly chocolate suggestions. Nicely malty finish, but a hint of burned building rubber.","Notes: The small-holding tribal growers of the Toraja region of the Indonesian island of Sulawesi produce coffees that, even more than the coffees of the neighboring island of Sumatra, typically express an earthy, often spicy, sometimes forest-floor character encouraged by unorthodox fruit removal and drying processes. This is number three in Starbucks' 2006 Black Apron Exclusives line of distinctive seasonally available coffees.  Visit www.starbucks.com for more information.","Who Should Drink It: Another decent but essentially listless and flat coffee from Starbucks, which over the past couple of years seems to have finally succumbed to the dangers of hugeness. In a case like this one I am not clear whether the coffee started out without character and energy, was held in the warehouse too long before roasting, was roasted badly, or whether it simply sat in the packaging so long after roasting and it went flat without going outright stale.",5,7,7,7,,,,31,44,2006,8,47.6038321,-122.330062,-2.4833826,117.8902853

Special Reserve Ethiopian Sidamo Natural Process,Green Mountain Coffee,89,"Waterbury, Vermont","Blind Assessment: A sweet fruit ferment contributes to an intense aromatic complexity that carries from nose to cup: Spicy, rose-like flowers, honey, blueberry, ripe peach, a hint of chocolate. The finish is rich and blueberry-toned, but cup and finish both stiffen just a bit as the coffee cools, revealing a hint of heavy astringency.","Notes: The unusual character of this coffee derives from two sources: botany and processing. The older, traditional Ethiopian varieties of the Arabica species that produce coffees like this one introduce a distinctive fruit and floral character to the cup. In the case of this coffee, the fruit notes are given a slightly fermented wine- and berry-toned nuance by the processing method, the dry or ""natural"" method, in which the beans are dried inside the coffee fruit rather than after the fruit has been removed. This coffee is organically grown and certified Fair Trade, meaning it was purchased from small-holding farmers at a ""fair"" or economically sustainable price.

Ethiopia Chichu,Novo Coffee,91,"Denver, Colorado","Blind Assessment: Powerful, sweet-toned aroma: cherry, honey, tea-rose, milk chocolate, with a very mild ferment that reads as delicate Riesling-like wine. In the cup the honey and rose-like floral notes persist lushly, with the fruit notes turning from dark cherry to a tarter coffee fruit. The felicitous ferment deepens, reading more as brandy than wine.

Black Apron Exclusive Kopi Kampung Sulawesi,Starbucks Coffee,86,"Seattle, Washington","Blind Assessment: Very sweet-toned, quietly complex aroma: smoke, semi-sweet chocolate and tart berryish fruit notes. Little of the aromatic complexity survives in the lean-bodied cup, only wisps of nut and crisp, smoky chocolate that fade quickly in the finish, leaving behind faint sweetness and a muted astringency.","Notes: The small-holding tribal growers of the Toraja region of the Indonesian island of Sulawesi produce coffees that, even more than the coffees of the neighboring island of Sumatra, typically express an earthy, often spicy, sometimes forest-floor character encouraged by unorthodox fruit removal and drying processes. This is number three in Starbucks' 2006 Black Apron Exclusives line of distinctive seasonally available coffees.

SLO Roasted Coffee Morning Fog Lifter,Central Coast Coffee Roasting,87,"Los Osos, California","Blind Assessment: The aroma is dominated by a very sweet scorched cedar and a spicy banana-toned fruit. Both carry nicely into the cup, which retains sweetness and a relatively rich mouthfeel despite the very dark roast. In the finish the sweet roastiness manages to outlast a slight astringency. One reader calls this the ""best coffee I've ever had.""","Notes: An extreme dark-roasted coffee, about as dark as a coffee can be roasted without literally burning it. Maintains a surprisingly substantial body and complex aromatics given the terminal darkness of the roast, probably owing in part to the capacity of traditionally processed Indonesian coffees like Sumatras to stand up to a very dark roast without losing character, and in part to a technique often called ""aroma roast,"" which shuts down the convection through the roasting drum for a brief interval at the end of the roast cycle.

Organic Guatemala,Caffe Vita Coffee Roasting Co.,88,"Seattle, Washington","Blind Assessment: A cup either pleasingly delicate or disappointingly simple depending on taste and expectation. Balanced, gentle aroma with a very fresh, foresty cedar and a suggestion of pear-toned fruit. In the cup the cedar and fruit tones finally settle into a sweet, raisin-toned chocolate.

Kona Fancy,Surf City Coffee,85,"Aptos, California","Blind Assessment: A contradictory coffee, with sweetly buoyant flowering grass and vanilla notes shimmering above a pungent heaviness in both aroma and cup.

Maui Mokka,Supreme Bean Coffee Roasters,85,"North Hollywood, California","Blind Assessment: Fermented fruit contributes to a glorious aroma dominated by a sort of dry, nutty chocolate. In the cup very sweet and floral but also quite astringent, netting a wildly ambiguous profile with intriguing fruit notes too astringent to call chocolate and too explosively fermented to call winy. Unorthodox palates might assign high ratings to this unusual coffee, while purists surely would choke and dismiss it. We compromised at 85 - buyers beware.","Notes: This unusual coffee, with its tiny, split-pea-like beans, is produced by a variety of Arabica (variously spelled Mokka, Moka, Moca) derived via Brazil from very old varieties still grown in parts of Yemen. Furthermore, it appears to have been processed using very ancient methods as well - dried inside the fruit (dry-processed), rather than after the fruit residue has been removed (wet process). Unfortunately, with this sample the fruit appears to have fermented heavily during drying, contributing a fermented fruit character that some will find attractive and others distasteful. Produced on the newly launched Maui Grown Coffee farm, a slimmed-down revival of the older, larger Kaanapali Coffee estate. The revived Maui Grown coffees should improve as things smooth out a bit at the mill.

100% Kona Peaberry Dark Roast,Bay View Farm,85,"Honaunau, Hawaii","Blind Assessment: Sweetly roasty throughout the profile: fresh-cut cedar and hints of cardamom and flowers in the aroma; in the cup silky in mouthfeel, very sweet, with continuing cedar and intensified floral notes. Slightly astringent, almost turpenny in the long finish.","Notes: Peaberries result when the coffee fruit develops only a single, oval bean rather than the usual pair of flat-sided beans.

Twigg-Smith Estate Ohana Medium Roast,Kona Blue Sky Coffee,87,"Holualoa, Hawaii","Blind Assessment: Fine aroma: delicate but deep, with milk chocolate, floral and caramelly fruit notes, apple perhaps. In the cup softly acidy, velvety in mouthfeel; the chocolate turns toward sweet cocoa with a richly tart floral twist. Surprisingly long finish, but also surprisingly heavy and even astringent. Cups were slightly uneven with occasional very faint musty fermented suggestions as they cooled, so a rating that started at 90 ended at an ambivalent 87.","Notes: The Twigg-Smith estate is a large farm by Kona standards (400 acres) on the slopes of Mt.

In the cup the acidity is sweet and well-integrated, the body full and mouthfeel supple, and the flavor quite sweet, with chastened but still rich complication: semi-sweet chocolate, ripe tomato, and a round, low-acid fruit that suggested banana.

Hair Raiser Blend,Hair Raiser Coffee,90,"Santa Barbara, California","Blind Assessment: Smoky, deep-toned aroma with a tightly-knit complexity: cedar, flowers, pineapple, vanilla, semi-sweet chocolate. Simplifies a bit in the cup, but remains richly and roundly bittersweet with an impressive smoky rather than burned character and a tickle of pineapply fruit. The sweet, expansive finish reveals a slight touch of astringency but the semi-sweet chocolate and fruit notes linger agreeably.","Notes: This coffee accomplishes what I would have thought impossible: It preserves a remarkable richness, sweetness, and complexity at an absolute dead-end darkness of roast. By way of comparison, this coffee is twice as darkly roasted as Starbucks' espresso blend, typically considered very dark-roasted. The result is an unusual, perhaps unique, flavor profile.

The aroma is intense and enveloping, with spicy ripe tomato, bittersweet chocolate, caramel, and banana-like fruit notes. The ripe tomato and dark chocolate notes carry into a cup shimmering with sweet, wine-toned acidity and the unusual banana-like fruit notes, which even seem reflected in the pleasant viscosity of the mouthfeel.","Notes: Pitalito comes from a highly respected growing area east of the Andes in the southern Colombian Department of Huila.

Sumatra Mandheling Supergrade,Cuvee Coffee,87,"Spring, Texas","Blind Assessment: Delicate but intense aroma: sandalwood, hints of cherryish fruit. In the cup lean in mouthfeel; the aromatic wood notes settle toward chocolate while the fruit displays a distinct and pleasant grapefruit twist. The chocolate and fruit persist only momentarily in the finish before they are lost in astringency. Reader Frank Baker nominated this coffee as ""a quintessential Sumatra, absolutely the best I have ever tasted.""","Notes: Mandheling is the traditional market name for an admired coffee type grown in the region around Lake Toba in north-central Sumatra.

Ethiopian Hama Gold Yirgacheffe Natural,Montana Coffee Traders,88,"Whitefish, Montana","Blind Assessment: Intense aroma, very sweet in impression, with round blueberry, fresh leather and cedar notes. In the cup the roast turns the blueberry toward a rich chocolate, but also seems to develop an astringent edge to the cup. In the finish the lovely blueberry chocolate barely makes itself heard above the persistent astringency.","Notes: This coffee is organically grown and Fair Trade certified, meaning it was purchased from small-holding farmers at a ""fair"" or economically sustainable price. In fact, it sold for considerably more than the Fair-Trade minimum price, since it is the second-place prize winner in the recent auction of small-holder cooperative coffees from Ethiopia conducted by the ECAFE Foundation (www.ecafefoundation.org), attracting a score of 91.5 from an international panel of judges. It was purchased at Internet auction by a consortium of smaller American roasting companies that included Montana Coffee Traders. It is certified organically grown and certified Fair Trade, meaning it was purchased from small-holding farmers, in this case the farmers of the Hama (also Hamma) Cooperative. Unlike most Yirgacheffe coffees, this one is dry or naturally processed, meaning the beans or seeds were dried inside the coffee fruit rather than dried after the fruit residue was removed, as is the case with wet-processed or ""washed"" coffees.

Organic Toraja,Kura Java Coffee,88,"Detroit, Michigan","Blind Assessment: A coffee whose uncompromisingly earthy character requires the same reorientation of conventional taste as do peaty malt whiskies. Distinct moist fallen leaf notes in the aroma with hints of sweet fruit ferment that with some imagination read as chocolate. In the cup the fallen leaf tones turn distinctly humus-like with continued hints of a sort of fermented chocolate. Medium body, syrupy mouthfeel. The chocolate notes persist in the finish, softening and complicating a hardish astringency.","Notes: An eight-year aged coffee originating in the Toraja growing region of the Indonesian island of Sulawesi. Aging only intensifies the genius of this gloriously primitive coffee. The distributor calls this coffee ""organic,"" but cites no certifications.

Colombia Tres Santos Micro-Lot Almaguer,Intelligentsia Coffee,93,"Chicago, Illinois","Blind Assessment: Pure yet extravagant notes of coffee fruit and flowers themselves carry with breathtaking simplicity from aroma into the sweetly acidy cup. I don't recall having experienced the taste of the coffee fruit (think sweetly tart cherries) and the voluptuous scent of the coffee flower (jasmine) so distinctly and so intensely. The slightly astringent finish and turn toward ripe tomato as the cup cools reveals that, at this writing, the coffee is perhaps a bit young, but drink it now because tomorrow it will be out the roaster door. Nominated by reader Herman Reichold who calls it ""one of - if not the - best coffees I have had the pleasure to drink.""","Notes: This coffee is a very small lot purchased by Intelligentsia based on its exclusive relationship with a group of seven small Colombian cooperatives of small holders. This particular lot, chosen by Intelligentsia coffee buyer Geoff Watts, was produced by small farmer Alciabiades Garcia at an average growing altitude of 5,400 feet from trees of the Caturra variety. Intelligentsia is a leading Chicago-area roaster with a Keith Haring-style logo, excellent coffee, and a commitment to quality epitomized by the practice of printing roast dates on coffee packaging.

"Hamma Cooperative Yirgacheffe, Fair-Trade Organic",Sacred Grounds Organic Coffee Roasters,95,"Arcata, California","Blind Assessment: The scent of blueberry fills the room simply in the act of grinding this explosively fragrant coffee. Blueberry continues richly to dominate the wet aroma, nuanced by hints of other low-acid fruit - peach perhaps, and chocolate. In the cup the fruit inclines more toward wine and a lush, minty chocolate, but the blueberry reasserts itself in the finish. Only in the long finish is there a hint of the serendipitous ferment responsible for much of this aromatic excitement. Probably as close to a perfect example of this coffee type as this imperfect world allows, tactfully roasted.","Notes: This coffee is organically grown and Fair Trade certified, meaning it was purchased from small-holding farmers at a ""fair"" or economically sustainable price. In fact, it sold for considerably more than the Fair-Trade minimum price, since it was the second-place prize winner in the recent auction of small-holder cooperative coffees from Ethiopia conducted by the ECAFE Foundation (www.ecafefoundation.org), attracting a score of 91.5 from an international panel of judges. It was purchased at Internet auction by a consortium of smaller American roasting companies that included Sacred Grounds. It is certified organically grown and certified Fair Trade, meaning it was purchased from small-holding farmers, in this case the farmers of the Hama (also Hamma) Cooperative.  Unlike most Yirgacheffe coffees, this one is dry or naturally processed, meaning the beans or seeds were dried inside the coffee fruit rather than dried after the fruit residue was removed, as is the case with wet-processed or ""washed"" coffees. Sacred Grounds is dedicated to roasting organic, Fair Trade and shade-grown coffees.

In the cup thin bodied and lean. The sweet, mildly fermented fruit reads as a sort of dilute, wine-toned chocolate. The sweet chocolate persists rather richly in the short finish, but seems to grow a bit cloying in the long. (Same coffee, same pod as brewed in a Black & Decker One-Cup Coffee Maker at a cup volume of 7 ounces): The musty-fermented notes that read as caramelly and chocolaty in the Senseo cup come across here as, well, musty and fermented, although they charitably can be read as a sort of twisted semi-sweet chocolate, think chocolate crossed with fresh tobacco.

Sumatra Golden Mandheling,Terroir Select Coffees,94,"Acton, Massachusetts","Blind Assessment: An extraordinary coffee in the earth and fruit style of traditional Indonesias. In the aroma moist leaves turning toward fresh earth, together with buttery, candyish top notes. In the cup full-bodied, with pungent, moist earth tones and crisp, low-acid fruit notes suggesting pear and cherry. The pungent tones smooth out in a sweetly rich finish.","Notes: Mandheling is the traditional market name for coffee grown in the region around Lake Toba in north-central Sumatra. Like many single-malt whiskies, Mandhelings gain much of their interest from odd or ambiguous flavor notes: earth, mild mustiness, slightly fermented fruit.

This lush flavor complex is heady in the aroma and sweetly refreshing in the cup. As the coffee cools, however, the ferment reveals a very slight bitter edge.","Notes: This unusual blend combines small-holder coffees from Mexico and Sumatra with coffee from the famous La Voz qui Clama en el Desierto (The Voice that Cries Out in the Desert) cooperative of indigenous Tzutuhil small-holding farmers in the Lake Atitlan region of Guatemala.

Ethiopia Yirgacheffe Natural Idido Misty Valley,Paradise Roasters,91,"Ramsey, Minnesota","Blind Assessment: An exotic, almost violent cup. The aroma is lush with intense, shifting ripe to overripe fruit and floral notes, blueberry most distinctly, with pungent, sweet spice undertones. In the cup the fruit notes turn markedly winy, or perhaps cidery. A fermented version of blueberry remains dominant, but the rich, complexly suggestive fruit notes hint at chocolate as well. A slight, pungent saltiness shadows the cup, but smoothes out reassuringly in a convincingly smooth, long finish.","Notes: A region of lush, rolling hills in south-central Ethiopia, Yirgacheffe is the most celebrated growing region for wet-processed Ethiopia coffee, meaning coffee that has been prepared by removing the fruit before the beans or seeds have been dried, resulting in a cleanly high-toned, intensely floral- and citrus-toned cup. The Yirgacheffe reviewed here, however, is a ""natural"" or dry-processed version of the great Yirgacheffe profile, meaning the beans/seeds were dried inside the fruit, producing a flavor profile that is lower toned and richer with a giddy, wild, slightly fermented fruit. Like virtually all Ethiopia coffees, this striking and unusual coffee is produced by villagers on small, garden plots interplanted with food and other subsistence crops.

Panama Esmeralda Especial,Stumptown Coffee Roasters,92,"Portland, Oregon","Blind Assessment: Exquisitely delicate aroma suggests a fine Oolong tea, with extravagant floral notes but a distinct (and coffeeish) hint of chocolate. The chocolate strengthens in the cup, with a tartly sweet, lemon-toned acidity. The lemon-chocolate notes outlast a gentle astringency in the long, pleasing finish.","Notes: The 2004 version of this exceptional coffee attracted a score of 95.6 from a jury of international coffee cuppers at the Best of Panama 2004 Cupping Event, then, at the subsequent auction, set what would appear to be a world record price for a green coffee - $21.00 per pound - paid by a consortium of American specialty roasters.

In the cup displays a simplifying sharpness when hot, but softens and sweetens as the cup cools. The seductively low-acid fruit notes persist from aroma into cup, reading as red wine and chocolate.

Ted found the body in the small cup light; Ken (81) found it fuller but rough in mouthfeel. Nor did Ken or Ted have much positive to say about flavor: pungent and rough for Ted, burned and sharp for Ken. In milk pleasantly sweet but thin-bodied for Ted; Ken was more positive here, finding that the milk smoothed out the sharply roasty character of the coffee, turning it toward a pleasing fresh leather and a clove-toned spice.

Ken (84) also found the mouthfeel too lean and the finish too astringent, but enjoyed the berry-like, chocolate-leaning fruit that carried through the profile from aroma to milk.

Ted found the aroma a bit flat; Ken found it delicate, with toast, apple and floral notes. Ted found the body fuller and the mouthfeel more substantial than Ken did. Both found the flavor in the small cup toasty/smoky and a bit sharp in the finish. Both admired the way the blend rounded and sweetened in milk. Nominating reader Robert Bobbs praised this blend as ""perfectly balanced ... big body, slightly sweet, not too much acidity but enough to enliven the cup; holds up well in big milky drinks but is fantastic as a straight shot.""","Notes: Coffee Review gave this blend a rave review and a rating of 93 in March 2005. The most likely reason for the drop in rating here are green coffees that faded or changed in the six months between reviews, but differences in roasting profile, staling after roasting, and, yes, inconsistencies in palates and nervous systems of reviewers, all are possibilities.

""Feel better not bitter,"" reads their trade-marked slogan. Reading between the lines of the website, it appears that the 33% figure is based on measurements of quinic acid, a substance associated with bitterness.

Organic Sumatran Reserve,Green Mountain Coffee,88,"Waterbury, Vermont","Blind Assessment: A complex fruitiness anchored by musty notes that read persuasively as sweet earth immediately identify this coffee as a traditional style Sumatra. The fruit reads most clearly as chocolate in the aroma, with tickles of raisin, citrus, perhaps papaya. In the cup sweet and bracingly earthy with a tart twist that suggests pineapple or grapefruit. Medium body. Rounds from short finish to long in a sweet, gently rich trajectory.","Notes: An organic, traditionally processed Sumatra from the highlands of tsunami-devastated Aceh Province, Sumatra. As is often true of traditional Sumatras produced by small holding farmers, some unevenness of flavor profile surfaced among the six cups we prepared of this sample, with the best cups suggesting a superb coffee worth a 90 rating, and others a touch bitter and heavy in their earth tones. Eight-eight is my guess at where this coffee will average out in the average drip brewer or French press.

Brazil (O cafe forte do Brasil),Cafe Pilao,80,"Sao Paulo, Brazil","Blind Assessment: In the aroma rich and simple, with musty/medicinal notes that aspire to chocolate but don't quite get there. In the cup full-bodied but gritty in mouthfeel, with dominating fermented fruit notes that can read as raisin or dried apricot and semi-sweet chocolate. Sweet in the short finish, astringent in the long.","Notes: Cafe Pilao is a traditional Brazilian-style coffee, grown, roasted, ground (very finely) and packaged in Brazil, and distributed in the United States by Cafe Pilao Coffee Importers, Canby Oregon. Higher quality specialty coffees are also available in many Brazilian stores and restaurants; Cafe Pilao represents the down-home style of Brazilian coffee.

Roasty and neutral in the aroma with subdued charred cedar tones and rather remote suggestions of fruit and nut. When hot the cup is burned and rather soapy, with perhaps some spice and cedar-toned chocolate. As it cools, however, the soapy tones recede and the chocolate intensifies, turns distinctly semi-sweet.","Notes: Iron Brew Coffee, a small-batch wholesale/retail roaster in South Carolina, roasts only Brazil coffee directly imported from farmers in the Cerrado region, a newer growing region distinguished by its dry, sunny fruiting and harvest season.

Brazilian,St. Ives Coffee Roasters,84,"Gainesville, Georgia","Blind Assessment: In the aroma intensely but cleanly roasty: pungent cedar with faint fruit undertones: papaya and apricot. In the cup the aggressive charred cedar tones continue to dominate, but the fruit becomes more explicit, rounding and sweetening toward chocolate.

Rich short finish, slightly astringent long.","Notes: Judging by cup character, this coffee is a traditional style of Brazil coffee processed by the natural or dry method, meaning the coffee was dried with both skin and flesh of the fruit still adhering to the beans.

In the small cup full body, buttery mouthfeel, and a distinct raisin-chocolate flavor with slight salty undertones. The raisin-chocolate carries into the rich finish, as does the shadow saltiness. In milk the chocolate rounds and sweetens richly from raisins to cherries with a whiff of fresh leather and a persistent hint of salt.","Notes: This espresso blend is roasted and ground in Italy and distributed in the United States by Tastes of the World, an online retailer and distributor of fine coffee, espresso, tea, chocolate, and related equipment and gifts. This blend is of a genuinely Italian style that is difficult to find in the U.S.: light-roasted, making use of naturally low-acid, lushly fruity, slightly fermented coffees, including some of the robusta species, to give it its sweet, raisin-and-brandied chocolate character. Note that this blend is sold pre-ground. The very fine grind will produce an excellent espresso in inexpensive (usually costing under $100) espresso brewing devices that use the simple pressure of trapped steam to force the water through the bed of ground coffee. Coffee lovers with more expensive and sophisticated home machines that use pumps or pistons to force the water through the coffee may find that the grind is a bit too coarse, producing a relatively short (under 14-second) shot.

Esmeralda Special Panama,The Roasterie,93,"Kansas City, Missouri","Blind Assessment: Intense, high-toned aroma, complex but tightly knit: lemon, dry berry, flowers (tea rose?), milk chocolate. The acidity is powerful but roundly balanced, the body surprisingly full, the flavor explosive: rose water, sweet pipe tobacco, chocolate, all enveloped in a lemony richness. Lemon and chocolate notes carry into the finish, where they soften and enliven a slight astringency.","Notes: This exceptional coffee attracted a score of 95.6 from a jury of international coffee cuppers at the Best of Panama 2004 Cupping Event, then, at the subsequent auction, set what would appear to be a world record price for a green coffee - $21.00 per pound - paid by a consortium of American specialty roasters led by Roasterie president Danny O'Neill.

Zimbabwe,The Sensuous Bean,83,"New York, New York","Blind Assessment: A potentially fine coffee compromised by mild mildew tones probably picked up during storage. The aroma is flat, potatoey and faded. In the cup, however, sweet, lushly winy tones compete with the musty hardness, a combination that some coffee drinkers may find attractive. The finish is rich and clean.","Notes: Historically Zimbabwe has been the premier coffee origin of southern Africa, admired for its moderately acidy, sweetly fruity coffees. At this writing, however, (February 2005) social and economic disruptions provoked by the controversial policies of President Robert Mugabe and international reaction to those policies may be threatening the quality and consistency of Zimbabwe coffee, although I suspect the mild mildew taint displayed by this sample is a symptom of too long a time in the warehouse; this is almost certainly last year's crop.

Tanzania Peaberry,Green Mountain Coffee,91,"Waterbury, Vermont","Blind Assessment: A tribute to the upside of slightly fermented fruit tones in coffee.

Tanzania Peaberry,Green Mountain Coffee,88,"Waterbury, Vermont","Blind Assessment: This coffee displayed a very slight ""old crop"" (faded, musty-mildew) character that caused co-cupper Christy Thorns to drop her score to 86. Ken (90) felt this shadow defect hardly mattered, however, given the cup's ""almost effervescent delicacy, with tickles of sweet cocoa, pipe-tobacco and caramel."" Christy offered a similar reading of the cup, but with less enthusiasm: ""Although a hint of mustiness somewhat masks the sweetness of the cup, tobacco, cedar and black pepper give this coffee some charm.""","Notes: Peaberries result when the coffee fruit develops only a single, oval bean rather than the usual pair of flat-sided beans.

Ethiopia Sidamo Organic,Thanksgiving Coffee,88,"Fort Bragg, California","Blind Assessment: Although co-cupper Christy Thorns (87) felt the Ethiopia citrus and floral notes turned ""somewhat passive"" under the impact of the roast, she praised the ""complex aromatics of ginger, clove and toasted grain"" and a spicy finish. Ken also found spice notes also in the aroma (black pepper, clove), but particularly admired the cup for its round mouthfeel and ""juicy and sweet but vegetal"" character, ""a bit like biting into a ripe plum and tasting the skin and the flesh at the same time.""

Harrar, unlike the more elegant and high-toned wet-processed coffees of southern Ethiopia (Yirgacheffe, Sidamo), is a dry-processed coffee, meaning the coffee cherries are simply picked and put out in the sun to dry, fruit and all.

Breakfast Blend,Starbucks Coffee,78,"Seattle, Washington","Blind Assessment: A thoroughly dispirited coffee, with little sweetness and limited nuance aside from hints of nondescript fruit and a sort of vegetal, slightly charred cocoa. This particular sample appears to consist of green coffees of ordinary to poor quality that were poorly roasted to boot. Presumably nominating reader C. Dowling got luckier than I did when he was inspired to nominate this blend as a ""mellow ... all-around coffee.""","Notes: Breakfast Blend is one of Starbucks' lighter roasted blends. Starbucks' limited edition wholebean coffees are often outstanding, but the quality-dampening demands of sheer volume appear to have taken its toll on main-menu blends like this one. Visit www.starbucks.com or call 800-782-7282 for more information.","Who Should Drink It: I found this particular sample a compromise coffee in the worst sense of the word, displaying neither dark-roast richness nor medium-roasted brightness.

Original Blend,Dunkin' Donuts,79,"Randolph, Massachusetts","Blind Assessment: This particular sample of Original Blend exhibited an almost academically thorough anthology of coffee taints and shadow defects. Some cups were flat and musty, others seemed additionally green and astringent, and some were rich with a rather pleasant apricot-toned sweet ferment (perhaps what nominating reader Des Cabigan cited as ""a sniff of oranges""). But not a single cup appeared on the table without some taint or other. Presumably the several nominating readers based their emails on a better iteration of the Original Blend than this one, something closer to the version to which I gave an 87 rating in 2002.","Notes: Dunkin' Donuts claims to be the world's largest coffee and baked food chain. The Dunkin' Donuts Original Blend has distinguished itself by carrying the torch for the classic medium-roasted American breakfast cup against the darker-roasted onslaught of Starbucks  (one side presumably hurling donuts and the other croissants). Two years ago I reviewed the Original Blend and found it a ""genuinely classic profile, acidy but full, cleanly floral and fruity."" If this sample is any indication, the Original Blend has slipped in quality every bit as badly as have Starbucks main-menu blends. This sample of the Original Blend was, at best, discouraging.

Kaffe Moose Drool,Hunter Bay Coffee Roasters,81,"Helena, Montana","Blind Assessment: Intensely roasty; no rubber tones but overwhelmingly charred. Rather light-bodied but dense in sensation. The burned notes carry resiny hints of charred pine and pungent Mediterranean herbs; rosemary perhaps. Reader P. Teel found this coffee ""deep, rich and flavorful.""","Notes: This dark-roast blend with its wonderful name combining hauteur (""Kaffe"") with rustic zoology was inspired by a similarly named ale from the Big Sky Brewing company.

Verona,Starbucks Coffee,81,"Seattle, Washington","Blind Assessment: Decent enough in the aroma: sweetly pungent, balanced, intensely roasty with a twist of slightly charred cedar. In the cup sweet and pungent, but the charred cedar notes turn to charred board notes, expressionless and woody. A vague hint of fruit at the top of the profile. I hope the nominating reader tasted a better sample of the Verona than this one.","Notes: Verona is one of Starbucks' darker roasted blends.

Traditional Roast,Gevalia Kaffe,85,"Gavle, Sweden","Blind Assessment: In the aroma this light-to-medium-roasted coffee is sweet, high-toned but round, with a whiff of lightly fermented fruit that suggests brandied chocolate. In the cup the agreeably rich, overripe fruit is complemented - or contradicted - by a sweet-toned but blunt acidity. The finish is long and rather heavily astringent.

Plantation Blend,CC's Coffee,85,"Baton Rouge, Louisiana","Blind Assessment: Complex aroma: sweet chocolate, some shimmers of flowers and spicy cedar. For me the cup was contradictory rather than balanced, its sweet chocolate tones uneasily cohabiting with a sharp acidity: think sweet-and-sour chocolate.

Rainforest Blend,Caribou Coffee,88,"Minneapolis, Minnesota","Blind Assessment: A lush, complex cup that derives some of its considerable appeal from slightly fermented fruit tones: apricot in the aroma, apple and pear in the cup, all turned overripe and slightly chocolate-leaning by the ferment.

In support of the substitution, Green Mountain points out that this Kenya AA is used at the famed Hyde Park campus, including at the Institute's Apple Pie Bakery Cafe.

Exotic berry-like flavor notes with fascinating wild black currant aftertaste. Balanced, sweet and intriguing with milk"" (93) Ken characterized the wild, sweet, edge-of-ferment fruit tones running through the profile from aroma to aftertaste as black cherry, and enjoyed them almost as much as Willem (90). In milk Ken completely concurred with Willem: ""sweet, balanced, lovely."" ","Notes: This coffee was recommended as espresso by a discerning Coffee Review reader, Richard Reynolds. Yemen's small-holding farmers prepare their coffee in the simplest of fashion: pick it and put it out, fruit and all, to dry on the roofs of their stone houses.

Honduras Intibuca,Intelligentsia Coffee Roasters,90,"Chicago, Illinois","Blind Assessment: Dry and forceful. The acidity is intense but sweet. The fruit is crisply austere: black currant, sauvignon blanc wine grapes. A challenging coffee that commands rather than seduces.","Notes: Shade-grown on the Dionicio Sanchez farm, imported by Volcafe Specialty Coffee, and scheduled to be roasted as a single origin by Intelligentsia Coffee Roasters and perhaps by others.

El Salvador Santa Ana,Intelligentsia Coffee Roasters,91,"Chicago, Illinois","Blind Assessment: Giddily sweet, rich, balanced. Gentle wine-toned fruit (call it chardonnay) and low-key floral notes run through aroma and cup, rounding toward milk chocolate n the finish. A superb expression of the El Salvador type.","Notes: One of several El Salvador Cup of Excellence competition winners purchased by Intelligentsia Coffee Roasters.

Original Blend,Eight O'Clock Coffee,65,"Montvale, New Jersey","Blind Assessment: An outright and unmistakably flavor-defective coffee. The aroma literally smelled like a whiff of something out of a summer sewer and the cup combined bitterly sharp mildew tones with rotten, compost-pile ferment.","Notes: Sold at A&P supermarkets, whole bean in 13-ounce sealed foil bag with one-way valve; $3.43/pound. In a worthy effort to deliver coffee of the respected arabica species at prices normally associated with coffee of the robusta species, Eight O'Clock Original over the years has tread a delicate line between filling its familiar red bags with outright defective arabica coffees and relatively decent-tasting ones. For me this month's sample set a new record on the defective end of the scale. Venerable Eight O'Clock Coffee claims to be America's number-one selling brand of whole bean coffee.  Visit www.eightoclock.com or call 800-299-2739 for more info.","Who Should Drink It: Only aficionados who have been spared the taste of a really foul coffee and want to know what one tastes like. Unfortunately for such researchers, but fortunately for coffee drinkers on a tight budget, other bags of Eight O'Clock Original are likely to range from considerably better than this example to only mildly repellant. In way of fairness, it also should be mentioned that other Eight O'Clock coffees, particularly the specialty Royale line, are apt to be much cleaner and better tasting than the Original blend.",3,4,5,7,,,,48,60,2003,6,41.0467635,-74.0229173,,
100% Colombian,Folgers,78,"Cincinnati, Ohio","Blind Assessment: An example of what coffee professionals call a dirty or uneven coffee. At best nutty, midtoned, rather monotoned, without much bounce or resilience. At worst some cups displayed a rather unpleasant ferment while others were woody and cloyingly peanutty.","Notes: Purchased at Pathmark, whole bean in sealed 12-ounce foil bag with one-way valve; $4.39/pound. Presumably an effort by Procter and Gamble to inject a branch of the venerable Folgers brand into the whole-bean specialty world.

House Blend,Starbucks,80,"Seattle, Washington","Blind Assessment: Either the green coffee was not up to the dark roast style, or the roast was conducted too aggressively: the roast dominates, producing a pungent and bitterly monotoned cup, with little to no nuance. The cup rounds and softens a bit as it cools, turning tenuously bittersweet.","Notes: Purchased at D'Agostino, whole bean in sealed 12-ounce foil bag with one-way valve; $11.99/pound. Starbucks' finest whole-bean specialty coffees are those featured on a seasonal basis in Starbucks retail locations. The Costa Rica Bella Vista and the Brazil Ipanema Bourbon often are excellent, for example. Based on my sampling, however, Big Green does not put its best beans forward in its supermarket line.

Mild ferment (the sugars in the coffee fruit begin to ferment before the removal of the fruit) is technically a taste defect, but many coffee drinkers enjoy mild, wine-like ferment tones when they are sweet and clean, as they are here. The problem with accidental virtues like a fortuitously sweet ferment is that it may not turn up in the next lot of the same coffee.",3,7,6,8,,,,47,58,2003,6,41.0762077,-73.8587461,,

Fair Trade Organic Sumatra,Bucks County Coffee,84,"Langhorne, Pennsylvania","Blind Assessment: This coffee provides about half the virtue of a great Sumatra: the full body and low-toned profile are here, but the vibrant dimension and complex nuance are missing. The cup is a bit monotoned and heavy rather than rich. Some bittersweet chocolate in the finish.","Notes: Purchased at A&P, ground in sealed 12-ounce foil bag with one-way valve; $10.65/pound. Certified organically grown and fair-traded, meaning farmers have been paid an economically sustainable price for this coffee based on internationally established price guidelines. Coffee from this Sumatra exporter has both impressed and mildly disappointed me over the past three or four years. This particular lot falls somewhere between those extremes.

India Monsooned Malabar,Porto Rico Importing Co.,85,"New York, New York","Blind Assessment: A fine monsooned Malabar with the usual low acidity and heavy body of this exotic origin, but here, in a skillfully executed light-roast style, unusually sweet with complex nuance: low-toned cantaloupe-like fruit and a pungent, gingery mustiness that easily reads as nut, and, with imagination, as malty toned chocolate.","Notes: Sold whole-bean in bulk; $6.99/pound.

Hawaiian Kona Blend,Pathmark's Mountain Harvest,85,"Carteret, New Jersey","Blind Assessment: Apparently the blender who created this faux Kona aimed at a richly sweet, winy, roundly fruit-toned cup. He or she largely succeeded, though the success is marred by very mild but flavor-flattening mildew tones.","Notes: Sold whole bean in bulk; $7.99/pound. Kona blends like this one, designed to capitalize on consumers' infatuation with the Kona name, typically contain very little actual Kona coffee, and usually a low grade at that. The quality of such blends reflects much more on the skill of the blender than on anything the Kona component brings to the blend. Mountain Harvest is roasted for Pathmark Stores.

Vintage Colombian,Dean & Deluca,89,"New York, New York","Blind Assessment: Aging apparently tamed the acidity and turned it low-key but vibrant. Rich, cherry and red-wine notes hint at chocolate with patient drinking.

This coffee was held for eight years after harvest and before roasting.

Ethiopian Harrar,Coffeemaria,78,"Hanover Park, Illinois","Blind Assessment: A wildly flawed but perversely interesting coffee. Dramatically uneven from cup to cup, with some cups dominated by a heavy and rather oppressive Mediterranean spice character (thyme or rosemary) and others displaying less oppressive and more pleasant floral and bitter fruit tones - in the latter case, imagine bitter-chocolate-covered jasmine petals.

100% Sumatra Lintong,Trader Joe's,89,"Monrovia, California","Blind Assessment: Lindsey Bolger exclaims: ""A lovely, well-structured coffee! In the dry fragrance I detected a slightly rancid note, suggesting staling. But after the pour and upon the break, a delightful aroma of brown sugar and cocoa bloomed to mask any lack of freshness. With a maple-syrupy sweetness, bright but restrained acidity and refined fruit notes, this is an excellent example of a classic Sumatra that defies the origin's reputation for earthiness"" (88). Ken concurred, finding ""both aroma and cup dryly acidy yet deeply sweet, lush with a sort of spicy fruit suggesting pineapple. Rich, smooth mouthfeel"" (89).

"Full City Sumatra (Organic, Fair-Trade)",Equal Exchange,89,"Canton, Massachusetts","Blind Assessment: Lindsey Bolger was all positive on this one: ""One of my favorites in the cupping. Chocolate laced with cinnamon punctuates the aroma. More sweet spice and cocoa, even some floral notes, emerge in the flavor. A fine specimen of a Sumatra -- tamed but not over domesticated!"" (88) Ken was attracted by ""an opulent, deep-toned fruity chocolate"" that nevertheless hinted at various flavor ambiguities like ferment. Ultimately, though, a ""rich, clean finish"" convinced him to go with a very positive reading (89) of this complex Sumatra. ","Notes: A certified Fair-Trade and organically grown coffee. Full City refers to the style to which this coffee has been roasted (not to the growing location, since they don't grow coffee in the city square of Medan).

Arabian Mocha Java,Starbucks Coffee,78,"Seattle, Washington","Blind Assessment: ""Light-bodied with an almost rioy flavor. Quakers, soft, wild-looking. Could have been better if roasted a little darker?"" (78). Rioy is a hard, medicinal flavor taken on by some dry-processed coffees during the drying. Quakers are beans that fail to take the roast and remain light, robbing the coffee of flavor and body. Ken: ""Burned tones, faint sweetness, not much else"" (78).","Notes: Mocha-Java is the world's oldest recorded coffee blend. The Starbucks version is authentic, combining wet-processed coffee from Java with dry-processed coffee from Yemen. Yemen's small-holding farmers prepare their coffee in the simplest of fashion: pick it and put it out, fruit and all, to dry on the roofs of their stone houses. Yemens can be among the finest coffees in the world, but the one that Starbucks used in this blend is not one of them, and constitutes the source of John Weaver's complaints in his blind assessment.

Starbucks-bashers will be surprised to find this an attractive and rather distinctive Kona.

The almost total lack of acidity leaves the cup listless and prey to a sort of negative nuance: a soapy bitterness.","Notes: Among Kona insiders, a controversial coffee. Grown from the traditional Kona typica variety of coffee tree grafted onto root stock of the sturdy but bland Liberica species, this innovative coffee was rejected for purchase by at least two Kona mill owners but subsequently won first place in the Gevalia 2000 Kona Cupping Competition. After picking this coffee out of over 20 Konas in a blind cupping as both spectacularly different and spectacularly bland, I definitely side with the nay-sayers.

By development I mean the profile transforms in subtle modulations from aroma through aftertaste -- in this case from chocolate and toast notes in aroma and cup to sweet spice tones in finish. Dimension means sensations resonate and expand in nose and on palate rather than standing pat at first impression.

Overall assessments of this sample ranged from bland on the downside to balanced on the upside. Which side of the bland/balanced divide panelists settled on probably depended on their predispositions in regard to the Kona profile generally.

Natural Moka – Green,Kaanapali Estate Coffee,,"Maui, Hawaii","Blind Assessment: To say this coffee has an atypical profile for a Hawaii coffee is an understatement. Comparing it to the other coffees in the cupping is worse than comparing apples and oranges - more like comparing apples and cocker spaniels. The Kaanapali dry-process Moka is, as one panelist called it, a ""Yemen wannabe."" The trees that produced it are Yemen varietals, and the coffee has been processed in the simple, put-it-out-in-the-sun-to-dry approach used in Yemen and parts of Ethiopia. Which means that, like a Yemen or dry-processed Ethiopia, it is fruity, winy, complex, with a disturbingly lush, overripe aftertaste that lovers of these coffees call gamy or wild and people who don't like Yemen or dry-processed Ethiopia coffees call fermented.Five panelists labeled this coffee fermented and dismissed it with very low scores; three recognized the Yemen/Ethiopia characteristics and treated it like a middle-of-the-road dry-processed Yemen/Ethiopia coffee, giving it scores in the high seventies. Four didn't call it anything but gave it low scores.If this coffee had been presented to the panel in the context of similar dry-processed coffees from Yemen or Ethiopia I don't think it would have provoked quite the same level of criticism.

Yellow Caturra – Green,Kaanapali Estate Coffee,76,"Maui, Hawaii","Blind Assessment: An interesting coffee that provoked a wide range of reaction. Everyone agreed that it was a soft coffee with medium body. The controversy centered on the flavor complex at the heart of the profile, which elicited characterizations ranging from ""delightfully spicy"" and ""richly chocolaty"" to ""harsh, burned and disturbing"" and ""burned seaweed, or something I had in a sushi bar(!)."" Scores also varied wildly. The nays didn't outnumber the yeas, but the naysayers nayed with more conviction than the yeasayers yeaed, culminating in a low average score.

Kona – Green,Fitzgerald Estate,84,"Kona, Hawaii","Blind Assessment: The clear winner in this cupping, as it was in the 1997 Kona Coffee Cultural Festival Cupping Competition. The reason: it clearly transcends the pleasantly mellow limits of the classic Kona profile. It displayed power, complexity, and an uncompromising, authoritative acidity, laid right on top of the usual soft, brightly sweet virtues of a typical Kona. Even the Kona-bashers on the panel liked this coffee. (Well, all but one.) Nobody raved, but there were lots of approving noises: ""excellent,"" ""very interesting, very clean on the palate,"" ""nice depth."" However, this excellent coffee might be too authoritative for those who like to slip into the softness of a more typical Kona. Lovers of Kona's sweeter, gentler side may prefer one of the less acidy profiles like the Guyer, Hamasaki, or Bayview Farms mill selections. The rather powerful acidity of this coffee casts doubt on the specialty coffee truism that only high growing altitudes (usually defined as over 4,000 feet) can produce solidly acidy coffees. The average elevation of the Fitzgerald Estate is around 1,600 feet.

El Salvador – Green,San Isidro Cooperative,71,El Salvador,"Blind Assessment: Most of the wallflower coffees near the bottom of the rankings managed to seduce at least one or two of the Cupping Board with their soft sweetness. I fell for this one. I found it light but pleasingly subtle and complex in the upper registers. I wasn't completely alone: ""nice, mild coffee""; ""smooth""; ""nutty, caramelly."" But a majority found little interest to offset the light body: ""common""; ""not very exciting""; ""crispy but boring.""

El Salvador – Green,Los Ausoles Cooperative,79,El Salvador,"Blind Assessment: Although the overall rating earned by this coffee was the same as the rating for the preceding Larin pacamara, the comments were less effusive.

Everyone else found it commonplace: ""A bit flat, though pleasant and inoffensive""; ""Okay, nondescript."" The most outspoken condemnation: ""Flat, dusty, institutional."" Curiously, although most cuppers found the taste flat, several cited piquant nuances: herbal, spicy, etc. Perhaps the piquancy suggests the potential of this coffee and the flatness is a weakness caused by rushed fermentation or errors in handling or storage. Support for the latter hypothesis comes from one very specific assessment: ""Slightly musty in the cup.""","Notes: A bit commonplace, with some sweetness, and some piquant nuances.

El Salvador – Green,Don Hilario,68,El Salvador,"Blind Assessment: A decent coffee ruined by a probably avoidable defect. Parts of the bag from which our samples came apparently picked up moisture during storage. Some individual samples (perhaps from the top part of the bag) cupped cleanly and sweetly, but most displayed either a rope-like taste called baggy (cited by five cuppers) or the moldy-basement taste called musty (two cuppers), both defects typically caused by post-processing moisture. Inspection of this coffee revealed more visual defects than displayed by any of the Itzalco coffees in the cupping, which may indicate something additional went wrong before the coffee went into the bag.","Notes: A decent coffee ruined by a defect called ropey, baggy, or musty -- typically caused by post-processing moisture.

""Great blender,"" said one, which led me to think about the difference between a great blender and a good blender. A great blender, it would seem, is a coffee that decisively strengthens or empowers other coffees without imposing itself, like a dinner guest who doesn't have much to say but makes everyone else at the table wittier and more graceful. Perhaps a ""good"" blender, on the other hand, just sits around amiably without causing problems. Be that as it may, I'm not sure everyone would agree with the ""great"" adjective either.

Green,Baja Vista,77,Guatemala,"Blind Assessment: A powerful but flawed coffee. Coffee professionals are familiar with the taste of ferment, caused when the sugars from the coffee fruit begin to go off while the fruit is still on the bean. The result is an odd, lush sensation that can register as ripe, overripe, or occasionally (particularly as the coffee cools) rotten. Cupper's comments reflect the ambivalence that mild ferment provokes. Almost everyone noted this coffee's luxuriant, wine-like fruitiness. Six cuppers detected a clear defect, however, and five of the six identified the defect (correctly in my view) as ferment, the shadow side of the fruitiness.

If you think you might love it, ignore the rating, which deducts for the ferment. Under the impact of the dark roast the ferment turns lush, almost spicy. Displays the usual Indonesia virtue of solid body.","Notes: A mildly, perhaps pleasantly, fermented coffee that is impeccably roasted.

Breakfast Blend,Green Mountain Coffee,90,"Waterbury, Vermont","Blind Assessment: An exquisitely balanced traditional American-style coffee. The acidity is dry without astringency, alive with slight fruit or wine notes. Enveloped in the matrix of the body, it is always present but never dominant.","Notes: An exquisitely balanced traditional American-style coffee.  Green Mountain Coffee Roasters is one of the country’s leading specialty roasters, offering a particularly wide-ranging variety of origins and roast styles.

Don't waste this coffee on a buffet, the fruit notes will burn off before anyone tastes them. Brew it in a drip maker, but drink it mindfully, right after it dribbles. Go easy on the additives. If you're entertaining a small group that mixes coffee snobs with supermarket palates, this one might have a shot at pleasing everybody.",3,7,8,7,8,,,56,65,1997,2,44.337125349999994,-72.75549720909403,44.933143,7.540121

Colombian Blend,Thanksgiving Coffee,85,"Fort Bragg, California","Blind Assessment: This coffee is so complex at the top that it positively levitates, alive with sweet, light vanilla tones. In the finish whatever is left of the body vanishes, the vanilla tones fade, but the sweetness lingers.","Notes: A coffee so complex at the top that it levitates, alive with sweet, light vanilla.","Who Should Drink It: Romantics. Should do well in both drip and French press. Brew it strong and it should stand up to milk but not require sweetener.
