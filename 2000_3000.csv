I continue to feel that it must have some direct relationship with Yemen, however, where varieties displaying the same, very unusual bean size and shape are known as Ismaili, as well as by other local names. This Mocca was processed by the dry or “natural” method, meaning the beans were dried inside the fruit rather than after the fruit has been removed, as is the case with wet-processed or “washed” coffees.

","Notes: This exceptional coffee was selected as the No. 5 coffee on Coffee Review’s list of the Top 30 Coffees of 2017.  This coffee is a collaboration between brothers Michael Johnson of JBC and Joseph Brodsky of Ninety Plus Coffee. It was produced entirely from trees of the celebrated Gesha variety of Arabica, and processed by a proprietary variation of the wet method in which the coffee fruit is subjected to fermentation and washing before drying. According to Brodsky, “This particular process is a result of a discovery of specific bacteria that are locally present at Ninety Plus Gesha Estates that were observed to yield unique flavor when applied to Gesha. These bacteria were subsequently cultivated and applied in a controlled way to focus and enhance their impact in the fermentation process. Lot 227 is part of a series of coffees in 2017 (Jose Alfredo Gesha Series), of which all, in varying degrees, exhibit this unique flavor.” Packaged in attractive and reusable decorative cans.

An unusual coffee in several respects. Coffees like this one from the northern part of the Indonesian island of Sumatra are valued for their complex earth and fruit notes that appear to result largely from unorthodox fruit removal and drying practices called “wet hulling.” This is a particularly refined example of the type. In addition, this coffee was subjected to a deliberate aging process by being held for three years in a specialized warehouse in Singapore. This sample consists entirely of peaberries, a kind of bean that results when the coffee fruit develops only a single, oval bean rather than the usual pair of flat-sided beans. Peaberries produce a somewhat different (often better) cup than normal beans from the same crop, from which they may or may not be separated during grading. This coffee tied for the highest rating in a cupping of aged, casked and specially cured coffees for Coffee Review‘s May 2017 tasting report.

Hints of flowers and sweet strawberry carry into a quiet but resonant finish.","Notes: Haraz (also Haraaz, other spellings) is a celebrated coffee growing region in north-central Yemen, west of the capital of Sana’a.

All Yemen coffees are natural-processed, or dried in the whole fruit. This particular Yemen may owe its striking aromatics to ancient tree varieties, but its clean elegance is most likely owing to the efforts of exporter Rayyan Mill in the capital of Sana’a, which has worked with farmers to improve picturesque but often haphazard harvesting and drying procedures.

Plumeria, chocolate fudge, white grapefruit, perique (fermented) pipe tobacco, white truffle in aroma and cup. Juicy, bright acidity; plush, syrupy mouthfeel. The resonant, flavor-saturated finish is long, balanced, and reiterates all of the tendencies in the cup: sweet (plumeria, chocolate), tart (white grapefruit), savory (pipe tobacco, truffle).","Notes: This exceptional coffee was selected as the No. 3 coffee on Coffee Review’s list of the Top 30 Coffees of 2017. Coffees from the northern part of the Indonesian island of Sumatra are admired for their complex earth and fruit notes that appear to result largely from unorthodox fruit removal and drying practices called “wet hulling.” This is a splendid example of the potential of the type. This sample consists entirely of peaberries, a kind of bean that results when the coffee fruit develops only a single, oval bean rather than the usual pair of flat-sided beans. Peaberries produce a somewhat different (often better) cup than normal beans from the same crop, from which they may or may not be separated during grading. JBC Coffee Roasters’ vision is simple: “let the coffee lead the way” through sourcing and roasting the best and most unique coffees available and rewarding the farmers who grow those coffees with substantial premiums.

An engagingly exotic coffee that polarized the three reviewers: John DiRuocco was lukewarm at 90, whereas Jen Apodaca was very enthusiastic at 95; Ken landed in the middle at 93. Ken read the coffee as driven by an attractive sweet ferment that for him suggested winey grape edging on grappa; John cited a fruit that for him was simultaneously ripe, tart and spicy; Jen went entirely positive on the fruit notes, citing in particular mango and passion fruit – fruit that taken together perhaps echoes John’s lush, tart and spicy reading. The cup was intense for John but not entirely coherent, while Jen found it expressed a “nice balance of acidity and sweetness.” Everyone found the coffee attractively complex in three parts milk, simultaneously lushly sweet and tart.","Notes: Grown at an elevation of approximately 6,000 feet (1,800 meters) and apparently processed by the dry-processed or “natural” method, meaning the beans were dried inside the fruit rather than after the fruit has been removed, as is the case with wet-processed or “washed” coffees.

Sturdy, balanced, chocolaty. All three reviewers (John DiRuocco 92, Jen Apodaca 94, Ken 92) cited caramel and chocolate; two read a particularly sweet orange (Ken called it orange marmalade).

Reviewer Jen Apodaca (95) loved this coffee: “rosewater, Meyer lemon, peach preserves, honey and brown sugar … Sweet and aromatic from start to finish … a standout in milk.” John DiRuocco (91) was less enthusiastic, though he praised this coffee’s delicacy and raisin and sweet chocolate notes.

Of three reviewers, Ken (93) was most supportive of this crisply chocolaty, silky-bodied espresso, citing its balanced range of baker’s chocolate, flowers and fruit. Jen Apodaca’s (92) descriptors overlapped Ken’s. For John DiRuocco (89), however, the sample was “a bit bipolar,” lacking coherence, although he praised the baker’s chocolate and pleasing mouthfeel.

Of three reviewers, John DiRuocco (95) most admired this crisp, floral-toned espresso: “complex and complete … floral, red fruit and stone fruit flavors … the body … light but sufficient, the finish clean and resonating.” Jen Apodaca (89) was considerably less enthusiastic and more terse: “There was a lot going on in this espresso … it finished like a dry red cabernet.” For Ken (91) this coffee represented a certain style of dried-in-the-fruit coffee: bittersweet, intriguingly anise- and lavender-toned, yet not quite sweet and fat enough for him.","Notes: This is a dry-processed or “natural” coffee, meaning the beans were dried inside the fruit rather than after the fruit has been removed, as is the case with wet-processed or “washed” coffees. This coffee tied for the second-highest rating in a tasting of single-origin espressos from the Americas for Coffee Review‘s November 2016 tasting report.

For more information visit www.turningpointcoffee.com.","The Bottom Line: The natural or dried-in-the-fruit processing here nets a crisp floral, anise and stone-fruit profile rather than the lusher tropical fruit profile we often associate with natural-processed coffees.

This Yirgacheffe is a “natural” or dry-processed version, however, meaning the beans/seeds were dried inside the fruit, encouraging a deeper-toned profile, more pungent than bright, though still extravagant in its aromatics. AHRIRE is a micro-roaster spun off from the ManLao River project, a non-profit project for alleviating poverty and protecting the environment in the Pu’Er region of Yunnan Province.
