","Notes: Maragogipe (Maragojipe in Spanish; also spelled Maragogype) is a rare botanical variety of Arabica famous for its huge beans. This Maragogipe apparently was processed by the “honey” method, meaning the skin was removed from the coffee fruit immediately after picking but the beans or seeds were dried with at least some of the fruit pulp or “honey” still adhering to them. This practice contrasts to the more conventional wet or washed method, wherein both skin and pulp are removed from the beans before drying. Although the big-beaned Maragogipe is not particularly admired for its cup character, this Kona honey version, skillfully roasted by Simon Hsieh, displays impressive character as a single-origin espresso.

Ken, at 92, liked this unusual sample better than co-taster Sean Kohmescher (90) did, perhaps because Ken read more depth in the aromatics and flavor. Sean stopped at citrus, honey and caramel in aroma and small cup whereas Ken added dark chocolate and pungent fir.

In two parts milk Ken and Sean read the cup about the same although applying slightly different language, with Sean citing lemon and ”light caramel” and Ken a “lemony chocolate.”","Notes: The possibility that this 100% Taiwan-grown coffee is a blend of different farms or different processes technically disqualifies it from consideration as a single-origin espresso in the contemporary definition, but it’s a fine espresso from a very unusual origin.

Although both Ken (94) and co-taster Sean Kohmescher (90) lavished a bundle of descriptors on this complex and challenging espresso, the real issue was how much to honor a pungent, musky character as it plays out in a well-pulled espresso. Both Ken and Sean were puzzled by the unusual aroma, but Sean, as he followed it into the cup, found it pleasing but just a bit edgy, perhaps musty, whereas Ken enthusiastically read it rich with the sort of pungent, earthy grapefruit character one finds in the best Sumatras. In two parts milk Sean found this flavor complex “musky” and “antique”; for Ken it was suavely nut-like. ","Notes: Grown on Fazenda Aurea near the town of Serra do Salitre. Raisin refers to the practice of systematically allowing coffee cherries to dry on the trees before finishing the drying on tables. Coffee fruit dried on the tree is particularly vulnerable to the molds that create a musty or mildewed character because it is not protected from moisture during drying as patio- or table-dried fruit is (or should be). So this is a tricky process, but when carefully pursued and the stars are aligned and the clouds stay away it can produce a fascinating espresso, as it does here.

House Blend (Tassimo T Disc),Starbucks,"Seattle, Washington",Not disclosed.,Very Dark,0/30,$10.49/12 T Discs,April 2011,87,Review Date:,April 2011,Aroma:,8,Acidity:,7,"Blind Assessment: (As brewed in a Tassimo single-serve brewing device to produce a 6-ounce serving): Intense aroma: raisin, nut, dark chocolate. In the cup rich, roast-muted acidity, full body, continued deep-toned dark chocolate and raisin-like fruit. Considerably bitter astringency mars an otherwise sweet, chocolate-toned finish.","Notes: The Tassimo system, with its Bosch-manufactured brewing device and matching proprietary T Discs, aims at providing a convenience-first single-serving solution for a variety of beverages, including filter-style coffee, tea, espresso-based beverages and hot chocolate. The Tassimo T Discs incorporate a bar code that instructs the brewing device how to prepare the particular beverage incorporated in the Disc. This instruction aimed to produce a tall cup of coffee from the Starbucks Disc, but we used the Tassimo manual override to produce a shorter, 6-ounce serving, which based on our tests, netted a better quality cup. Tassimo is a division of Kraft Foods, with T Discs currently offered by brands mostly associated with Kraft. The recent breakup of Starbucks and Kraft means that most likely the Starbucks Discs, which in our tests produced by far the best American-style cup for the Tassimo, no longer will be available for the system. Visit www.starbucks.com or call 877-834-7271 for more information.","Who Should Drink It: Brewed short at 6 ounces an excellent single-serve rendition of a strong, Starbucks-style darker-roasted cup. Get it while it lasts, however; the Starbucks/Kraft breakup doubtless will wipe this T Disc option off the shelves."

Any company that has access to the appropriate machinery can produce them. Although ""pod adaptors"" are available for many home espresso machines, ESE pods appear to produce best results when used on home machines exclusively designed for them. We tested this set of sample pods on the pod-only FrancisFrancis! X6 Trio home espresso machine, which allows for some control of extraction rate by how firmly the pod-bearing portafilter is tightened into the machine. We evaluated this espresso at a 35-second extraction for a one-ounce serving. The blend includes 10% Robusta, with the balance made up of coffees of the Arabica species.

Although some fruit complexity is lost in the finish, a cocoaish sweetness lingers far into the long.","Notes: Unlike the majority of Ethiopia coffees imported to North America, which are processed by the more orthodox wet or washed method, this is a dry-processed or ""natural"" coffee, meaning the beans are dried inside the fruit rather than after the fruit is removed, as is the case with wet-processed coffees.

Honey-sweet aroma with notes of aromatic wood, dark chocolate, raisin. In the small cup full mouthfeel and a deeper rendition of dark chocolate and raisin; hints of floral and citrus brightness. Long, resonant, flavor-saturated finish. Unusually complex in two parts milk, with notes ranging from milk chocolate to dry walnut.","Notes: S. O. (for Single-Origin) is Paradise Roaster's designation for its line of espressos based on green coffees from distinguished single growing regions. In this case the single-origin green coffee comes from trees of an interspecies hybrid that crosses the species that American specialty roasters love to patronize, robusta, with another species of coffee entirely, Coffea congensis. Hence the acronym: Congensis into Robusta, or CxR. Developed and grown in India, this hybrid has proven to produce exceptional coffees of the low-acid, big-bodied style that European buyers admire and American buyers have yet to explore. It is a special sun-dried example of this hybrid species, impeccably processed on India's Sethuraman Estate. Paradise Roasters prides itself on roasting and shipping coffee only after orders are placed. Its metaphoric mission is to bring some paradisiacal warmth from the coffee-growing south to the cool environs of Minnesota.

The fruit reverts to orange peel in the finish. In two parts milk the fruit turns to chocolate but sustains a complicating brandy and orange-peel edge.","Notes: Unlike the majority of Ethiopia coffees imported to North America, which are processed by the more orthodox wet or washed method, this is a dry-processed or ""natural"" coffee, meaning the beans are dried inside the fruit rather than after the fruit is removed, as is the case with wet-processed coffees. When all goes well and the fruit dries cleanly, without developing fermented or musty notes, this ancient procedure can contribute lush, berry-toned sweetness to the beans, as it does here.

""Utterly pure yet soaringly intense,"" for Ken (97). ""Say fruit ten times,"" Andy reports, and then he does, mainly variations of grapefruit, apricot and melon with green apple and Bartlett pear thrown in for the finish.

For mouthfeel Andy suggests ""crème fra&icirc;che Meyer lemon chiffon""; Ken sticks with a pedestrian ""syrupy."" Ken awarded a perfect 10 to the long, balanced, deeply flavor-saturated finish.","Notes: Ka'u is a newly emerging Hawaii coffee growing district centered 30 miles or so south of the famous Kona region. This extraordinary coffee is the result of a deliberate experiment isolating coffee from fifty or so trees of the Bourbon variety growing on a section of the small farm of Lorie Obra in Ka'u. Its unusual character doubtless derives from its Bourbon heritage, but its quality is owing to the sort of artisan meticulousness that rarely happens in such a thorough-going way in the practical, cost-driven world of coffee: Ripe fruit was picked by Lorie herself, not by hired pickers, the fruit removal was performed by the traditional ferment and wash method, and the sun-drying was particularly watchful. Lorie hopes to produce about fifty pounds of this coffee next year, at which time at least a few others besides the Coffee Review reviewers will have an opportunity to enjoy it.

Gently smooth acidity, medium body.","Notes: Doi Chaang is a single-estate coffee produced by a northern Thailand hill tribe in the Golden Triangle mountains of Thailand and roasted in Alberta, Canada. The independent coffee growers receive over 50% of the profits of this unusual and pioneering venture.

Kenya AA Lenana,Après Coffee,"Lancaster, Pennsylvania",South-central Kenya,Medium-Dark,42/53,June 2009,8,92,Aroma:,8,Acidity:,8,Body:,7							,"Blind Assessment: Rich, very intense aroma: dark chocolate, aromatic wood, nut, hints of citrus: orange, tangerine. The cup is influenced by a moderately dark roast, which nicely rounds acidity and turns the celebrated Kenya dry berry notes toward a crisply sweet cocoa or dark chocolate, with a continued shimmer of citrus. The berry-toned chocolate carries into a simple, rich finish. The only limitation of this graceful coffee is a lean, almost thin mouthfeel, though that could be admired as another expression of its complex delicacy.","Notes: Despite stresses brought on by social unrest, charges of corruption and a confused transition toward an open market, the famed Kenya coffee auction system and its participating cooperatives continue to produce some of the world's most elegant and distinctive coffees.

Byron (92) on the other hand read almost all positives in the fruity richness: ""dark and spicy flavors blended to a round, sweet, nutty finish that left a post-ice-cream mouthfeel.

Italian Espresso Blend,Moksha Coffee Roasting,"Mountain View, California",Not disclosed.,Medium-Dark,42/52,May 2009,8,91,Aroma:,8,Body:,8							,Flavor:,8,"Blind Assessment: Ken (92) enjoyed this espresso considerably more than did co-taster Byron Holcomb (89). The reason may have been their differing reactions to the influence of a fruity fermented character that Ken read as pleasingly brandy-like and Byron as dry white wine at best, bitterish seed-and-skin, muscadine grape at worst. Similarly, Ken was more positive toward a fresh-cut cedar character in aroma and flavor. Ken did have reservations about finish, where a hint of the heavy, salty side of the fruit ferment showed up. Byron gave the blend a break in four parts milk, where he described its impact as ""white grape juice, subtle but nice, clean.""

Co-taster Byron Holcomb (90) read the earthy and mildly musty side of the blend: earth and molasses in the aroma, ""musty, cedar - a little confused"" in the small cup. Ken (92) on the other hand, read the confusion as complexity and emphasized the Ethiopian elements, particularly the flowers and fruit, which for him gave the cedar and earth tendencies an anise-like liveliness.

(for Single-Origin) is Paradise Roaster's designation for its line of espressos based on green coffees from distinguished single growing regions. In this case the single origin comes from trees of an interspecies hybrid that crosses the species that American specialty roasters love to patronize, robusta, with another species of coffee entirely, Coffea congensis. Hence the acronym: Congensis into Robusta, or CxR. Developed and grown in India, this hybrid has proven to produce exceptional coffees of the low-acid, big-bodied style that European buyers admire and American buyers have yet to explore. It is a special sun-dried example of this hybrid species, impeccably processed on India's Sethuraman Estate. Paradise Roasters prides itself on roasting and shipping coffee only after orders are placed.
