Ken liked the aromatic excitement of the ""floral and fruit notes with complex smoky undertones"" that he followed with pleasure from aroma through finish to milk. Although he found the small cup a bit sharp and thin-bodied, he forgave all in return for the floral and fruit complexity. (89) Willem, on the other hand, tasted nothing but imbalance and too much acidity: ""Somewhat dull aroma with minor earthy notes"" and in the small cup ""mildly sharp and some uncontrolled acidity."" He was a bit more forgiving with performance in milk: ""sweet, bright, with caramel aftertaste.""
