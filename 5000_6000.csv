Complex flavors with more floral upfront, subtle, tart citrus tones and lots of sweetness. Clean finish with lingering floral hints.""","Notes: Processed by the traditional Brazilian natural or dry method, meaning the beans were dried with both skin and fruit still adhering to the bean. A semi-arid climate prevailing during harvest apparently permits farmer Reginaldo Silvoni to achieve a purity of profile, free of fermented sugars or mildew, despite the relatively lengthy drying period occasioned by drying coffee inside the tough fruit skin.

The Bourbon character, a sort of sweetly dry berry note often described as black currant, is quite prominent in this coffee. From the Carmo de Minas growing region, an area relatively high in altitude and cool in climate, which may account for this coffee's bright, complex acidity.

Co-cupper Miguel Meza (87) describes them as: ""Sweet-smoky and medicinal. A pungent and musty full-bodied coffee with exotic hints of eucalyptus, sassafras and bakers' yeast.""  Ken (86) is more conventional and more positive: ""Rich, raisiny dark chocolate with a pungent cedar and herbal edge in aroma and rather syrupy cup.""","Notes: A dry-processed or ""natural"" coffee, meaning the beans were dried inside the fruit rather than after the fruit has been removed, as is the case with wet-processed or ""washed"" coffees. Although Ethiopia is the botanical home of Coffea arabica, Yemen introduced the beverage to the rest of the world in the 16th and 17th centuries. Amazingly, little has changed in the Yemeni coffee industry since then; coffee is still grown from ancient cultivars, sun-dried on the roofs of stone houses and hulled by millstone.
